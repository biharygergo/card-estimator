It is a fun and engaging way for teams to apply relative estimates to planned work. Planning Poker can be used to improve [Sprint Planning meetings](/knowledge-base/how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning) and deliver more value to customers.\n\nThe three Scrum roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers, all play a role in using Planning Poker effectively.\n\n### The Product Owner\n\nThe Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, which is a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done to develop the product. The Product Owner also works with the team to estimate the effort required for each Product Backlog Item (PBI).\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Product Owner is responsible for:\n\n- Reading the PBI aloud to the team\n- Answering any questions that the team has about the PBI\n- Helping the team to reach a consensus on the estimate for the PBI\n\n### The Scrum Master\n\nThe Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team to follow the Scrum framework. The Scrum Master also helps the team to remove any impediments that are preventing them from delivering value to customers.\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Scrum Master is responsible for:\n\n- Facilitating the session and keeping it on track\n- Ensuring that everyone on the team is participating and that their voice is heard\n- Helping the team to resolve any conflicts or disagreements\n\n### The Developers\n\nThe Developers are responsible for delivering the work in the Sprint Backlog. They are also responsible for estimating the effort required for each PBI.\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Developers are responsible for:\n\n- Selecting a Planning Poker card that represents their estimate of the effort required for the PBI\n- Discussing their estimates with the team and trying to reach a consensus\n- Providing feedback on the estimates of other team members\n\n## How the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively\n\nThe Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively by:\n\n- **Communicating effectively.** It is important for all three roles to communicate effectively during a Planning Poker session. The Product Owner needs to be able to clearly explain the PBI, the Scrum Master needs to be able to facilitate the discussion, and the Developers need to be able to share their estimates and feedback.\n- **Trusting each other.** It is also important for all three roles to trust each other. The Product Owner needs to trust the Developers to provide accurate estimates, and the Scrum Master needs to trust the Product Owner and Developers to work together to reach a consensus.\n- **Being open to feedback.** Everyone on the team should be open to feedback from the other team members. This will help to ensure that the estimates are accurate and that the team is on the same page.\n\nBy following these tips, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively and improve their team's velocity. For a deeper dive into estimation techniques, check out our guide on [comparing different agile estimation approaches](/knowledge-base/comparing-agile-estimation-techniques).\n\n**Additional tips for using Planning Poker effectively:**\n\n- Use a Fibonacci sequence to estimate effort. This will help to avoid estimating in whole numbers and to make more accurate estimates.\n- Be honest with your estimates. Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" or to change your estimate if you hear new information.\n- Have fun! Planning Poker should be a fun and collaborative experience. Don't take it too seriously.\n- Use an online tool for estimating, as it makes things easier to track and more enjoyable. Give [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live) a try!

Agile estimation techniques are used to help teams plan their work and set realistic expectations.\n\nThere are a number of different agile estimation techniques available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this blog post, we will compare some of the most popular agile estimation techniques, including:\n\n* [Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) - Learn more about how [different Scrum roles use Planning Poker effectively](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles)\n* [T-shirt Sizing](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing)\n* [Dot Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting)\n* [Wideband Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wideband_delphi)\n* [Three-Point Estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_estimation)\n\n## Comparison Table\n\n| Technique | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Planning Poker | A consensus-based estimation technique where team members select cards with different values to represent their estimate for the effort required to complete a task. | Easy to learn and use, reduces bias | Can be inaccurate if team members are not familiar with the work to be done |\n| T-shirt Sizing | A relative estimation technique where team members estimate the size of a task by comparing it to other tasks that they have completed in the past. | Quick and easy, good for new teams | Can be inaccurate if team members do not have a good understanding of the work to be done |\n| Dot Voting | A simple estimation technique where team members place dots on a card to represent their estimate for the effort required to complete a task. | Quick and easy, good for large teams | Can be inaccurate if team members are not honest with their estimates |\n| Wideband Delphi | A structured estimation technique where team members estimate the minimum, maximum, and most likely effort required to complete a task. | More accurate than other techniques, good for complex tasks | Can be time-consuming |\n| Three-Point Estimate | A structured estimation technique where team members estimate the minimum, maximum, and most likely effort required to complete a task. The team then calculates the weighted average of the three estimates to arrive at a final estimate. | More accurate than other techniques, good for complex tasks | Can be time-consuming |\n\n## Choosing the Right Agile Estimation Technique for You\n\nThe best agile estimation technique for you will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\n* The size and experience of your team\n* The type of work you are doing\n* The level of accuracy you require\n\nIf you are new to agile estimation, I recommend starting with a simple technique such as [Planning Poker](/knowledge-base/how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning) or T-shirt Sizing. Once you have more experience, you can try more complex techniques such as Wideband Delphi or three-point estimating. Most Planning Poker tools also support T-shirt sizing, such as PlanningPoker.live.\n\n## How to Use Agile Estimation Techniques Effectively\n\nHere are some tips for using agile estimation techniques effectively:\n\n* Use the right technique for the job. Different estimation techniques are better suited for different types of work. For example, Planning Poker is a good choice for estimating simple tasks, while Wideband Delphi is a better choice for estimating complex tasks.\n* Get everyone involved. Agile estimation is a team-based activity. It is important to get everyone involved in the estimation process, including developers, product owners, and testers.\n* Use relative estimation. Relative estimation is more accurate than absolute estimation. When estimating tasks, compare them to other tasks that you have completed in the past.\n* Be realistic. Don't underestimate or overestimate the effort required to complete tasks. Be realistic and honest with your estimates.\n* Update your estimates regularly. As you learn more about the work, update your estimates accordingly.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAgile estimation techniques are a valuable tool for helping teams plan their work and set realistic expectations. By choosing the right technique for the job and using it effectively, you can improve your team's ability to deliver on its commitments.\n\n## Additional Tips\n\nHere are some additional tips for using agile estimation techniques:\n\n* Use a tool to help you manage your estimates. There are a number of tools available that can help you to track and manage your estimates.\n* Review your estimates regularly. Meet with your team on a regular basis to review your estimates and make sure that they are still accurate.\n* Be flexible. Agile estimation is an iterative process. It is important to be flexible and willing to adjust your estimates as needed.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your team's use of agile estimation techniques and improve your team's ability to plan and deliver on its commitments.\n"},{"title":"How to use Planning Poker to improve your sprint planning meetings","description":"Learn how to use Planning Poker to improve your sprint planning meetings and deliver more value to your customers.","slug":"how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning","lastUpdated":"2023/10/07","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"pexels-fauxels-3184306_vv2kvt","coverImageAlt":"A group of people during a meeting","category":"guide","tags":["Planning Poker","Sprint Planning","Agile Estimation","Team Collaboration","Estimation Techniques"],"content":"## What is Planning Poker?\n\nPlanning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort in agile software development. It is a fun and engaging way for teams to apply relative estimates to planned work. Planning Poker can be used to improve sprint planning meetings in a number of ways:\n\n- **It helps to reduce bias and groupthink.** In traditional estimation techniques, the loudest or most influential team members may tend to dominate the discussion and influence the estimates. Planning Poker helps to level the playing field by giving everyone an equal voice.\n- **It encourages collaboration and communication.** Planning Poker is a team exercise that requires everyone to participate and share their thoughts. This helps to foster collaboration and communication within the team.\n- **It leads to more realistic estimates.** Planning Poker estimates are based on the collective knowledge and experience of the team. This makes them more likely to be realistic and achievable than estimates that are made by individuals.\n\n## How to use Planning Poker in your sprint planning meeting\n\n1. **Prepare.** Make sure that everyone on the team has a deck of Planning Poker cards. You can use physical cards or an online tool such as [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live). Using an online tool is a good idea, since it automatically tracks estimates, history and calculates statistics.\n2. **Read the user story.** The Product Owner reads the user story aloud to the team and sets the topic in the app.\n3. **Estimate.** Each team member selects a card from their deck that represents their estimate of the effort required to complete the user story.\n4. **Reveal.** Everyone reveals their cards at the same time. When played online, this step is done by the leader of the meeting.\n5. **Discuss.** If the estimates are widely different, the team discusses the reasons for the differences and tries to reach a consensus.\n6. **Repeat.** Steps 3-5 are repeated until the team reaches a consensus on an estimate for the user story.\n\n## Tips for using Planning Poker effectively\n\n- **Use a Fibonacci sequence.** Planning Poker cards are typically numbered in a Fibonacci sequence, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89. This sequence helps to avoid the tendency to estimate in whole numbers. You can learn more about different estimation techniques in our [comparison guide](/knowledge-base/comparing-agile-estimation-techniques).\n- **Use relative estimates.** Planning Poker estimates are relative to each other, rather than to a specific unit of time. This helps to avoid the problem of overestimating or underestimating complex tasks.\n- **Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know.\"** If you don't have enough information to estimate a user story, it's okay to say so. The goal of Planning Poker is to get a rough estimate of the effort required, not to be precise. When played online, you can add a \"Pass\" card to the deck to represent this vote.\n- **Don't be afraid to change your mind.** If you hear new information during the discussion phase, you can change your estimate. The goal is to reach a consensus on an estimate that everyone is comfortable with.\n\n## Additional tips\n\n- **Start with a small set of user stories.** Don't try to estimate all of the user stories for the Sprint in one sitting. Start with a small set of user stories, and then come back to the rest later.\n- **Take breaks.** Planning Poker can be mentally draining, so it's important to take breaks. Get up and move around, or do something else for a while.\n- **Keep a human connection.** Use Planning Poker in real-life or during a video conference. You can [install an extension](https://planningpoker.live/features) of PlanningPoker.live in your favorite video conferencing tool to see each other during the session.\n- **Have fun!** Planning Poker should be a fun and collaborative experience. Don't take it too seriously.\n\nPlanning Poker is a powerful tool that can help you to improve your sprint planning meetings and deliver more value to your customers. By following the tips above, you can use Planning Poker effectively to estimate the effort required for your Sprint Backlog items.\n\nLearn more about [how different Scrum roles can use Planning Poker effectively](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles).\n"},{"title":"How to estimate JIRA issues with Planning Poker","description":"In this short tutorial you can learn how to set up an integration with JIRA in PlanningPoker.live and estimate tickets with ease","slug":"how-to-estimate-jira-issues-with-planning-poker","lastUpdated":"2024/10/20","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"topics","coverImageAlt":"A graphic showing issues stacked over each other","youtubeVideoId":"X5ox2EBk3Bs","category":"guide","tags":["JIRA Integration","Planning Poker","Agile Estimation","Task Estimation","Project Management"],"content":"\n### Introduction\n\nPlanning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort or complexity.

After the estimates are revealed, simply click the **Upload** button to save the estimate back to Jira.\n\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img alt=\"Use the topic editor to search for issues\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/planning-poker-public-assets/assets/jira_search.png\">\n    <p>Use the topic editor to search for issues</p>\n</div>\n\n4. **Batch import multiple Jira issues.** If you have several issues in your backlog that need to be estimated, PlanningPoker.live makes it easy with the **Batch Import** feature. To do this:\n   - Open the sidebar and click on **Import/Export**.\n   - Select **Batch Import Issues**.\n   - In the dialog, apply filters to find the relevant issues, such as filtering by project or sprint.\n   - Once you've selected multiple tickets, click **Import** to add them all to your current estimation session.\nThis feature helps you quickly gather all the necessary issues for estimation, making your planning sessions more efficient, especially when dealing with large backlogs.\n\nThe Batch Import feature significantly streamlines the estimation process for Agile teams working with large backlogs. Instead of manually importing each issue one by one, you can now pull in multiple tickets at once, saving time and ensuring that all necessary tasks are reviewed in a single session. This is especially useful for sprint planning meetings or backlog refinement sessions when you need to estimate several tasks quickly.\n\n5. **Discuss the estimates and come to a consensus.** That's it! Select an issue and once everyone has cast their vote, the results will be displayed. Discuss the estimates and come to a consensus on the estimate for each issue.\n\n### Some further tips\n\nHere are some tips for estimating JIRA issues with the Planning Poker technique:\n\n- **Use a clear and concise estimation scale.** A common estimation scale is the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). This scale is effective because it allows for a wide range of estimates, but it is still relatively easy to understand and use.\n- **Don't be afraid to revise your estimates as you learn more about the work involved.** It is perfectly normal to revise your estimates as you learn more about the issue and the work involved.\n- **Hold regular Planning Poker sessions to estimate new JIRA issues and to revisit the estimates for existing issues.** This will help to ensure that your estimates are always up-to-date and that your team is on track to deliver projects on time and on budget.\n\nBy following these tips, you can use Planning Poker to effectively estimate JIRA issues and improve your team's communication, collaboration, and confidence.\n\nPlanning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort or complexity.

Discover solutions to boost collaboration and efficiency in your sprint planning sessions.","slug":"common-mistakes-planning-poker","lastUpdated":"2024/06/01","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"poker-cards_akrfnx","coverImageAlt":"An ace poker card","category":"technique","tags":["Planning Poker","Agile Mistakes","Estimation Techniques","Sprint Planning","Team Collaboration"],"content":"\n## Introduction\n\nPlanning poker is an excellent tool for agile teams to estimate project effort collaboratively. Learn more about [how different Scrum roles can use Planning Poker effectively](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles).\n\n## 1. Lack of Preparation\n\nPreparation is crucial for a successful planning poker session. Ensure that the user stories are well-defined and the acceptance criteria are clear. Without this, team members might have different understandings of the story, leading to inaccurate estimates.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Hold grooming sessions beforehand.\n- Ensure stories are broken down to manageable sizes.\n- Clarify any ambiguities in the user stories and acceptance criteria.\n\n## 2. Dominance of Senior Team Members\n\nIn some teams, senior members or more vocal individuals may dominate the discussion, influencing the estimates of others. Encourage all team members to share their views independently before discussing the estimates to avoid this bias.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Use anonymous voting tools to ensure independent input (pro tip: PlanningPoker.live [supports anonymous voting](https://planningpoker.live/features)!)\n- Facilitate discussions in a way that encourages quieter team members to voice their opinions.\n- Rotate facilitators to prevent dominance by a single individual.\n- Learn more about [how to improve sprint planning with Planning Poker](/knowledge-base/how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning).\n\n## 3. Underestimating Story Complexity\n\nTeams sometimes overlook the complexity of a user story, leading to underestimation. Discuss potential challenges and dependencies thoroughly before voting to get a more accurate estimate.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Encourage detailed discussions on possible technical challenges and dependencies.\n- Use historical data to inform complexity estimations.\n- Break down complex stories into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n\n## 4. Skipping Discussion on Disparities\n\nWhen there's a significant difference in estimates, it's essential to discuss the reasons behind the disparity. This discussion often reveals overlooked details and leads to a more accurate consensus.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Always discuss outliers and the reasoning behind high and low estimates.\n- Use these discussions as learning opportunities for the team.\n- Document insights gained during these discussions for future reference.\n\n## 5. Ignoring Team Capacity\n\nEven if the estimates are accurate, not considering the team's capacity can derail a sprint. Balance the estimated workload with the team's available capacity to avoid overcommitment.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Regularly update and track team capacity.\n- Adjust the sprint backlog based on team availability.\n- Consider factors like holidays, vacations, and other commitments.\n\n## 6. Using planning poker for Every Story\n\nWhile planning poker is valuable, it's not necessary for every user story, especially small or well-understood tasks. Reserve it for complex or high-uncertainty stories to keep sessions efficient.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Categorize stories based on complexity and uncertainty.\n- Use planning poker selectively for high-impact stories.\n- Develop a streamlined estimation process for simpler tasks.\n\n## 7. Infrequent Sessions\n\nHolding planning poker sessions too infrequently can lead to rushed estimations or forgotten context. Regular, scheduled sessions help maintain consistency and accuracy in estimates.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Schedule regular planning poker sessions, ideally at the beginning of each sprint.\n- Ensure that these sessions are prioritized and attended by all relevant team members.\n- Use these sessions to maintain a backlog of estimated stories.\n\n## 8. Over-Reliance on Numbers\n\nTreat planning poker estimates as guidelines rather than exact figures. Agile projects are inherently flexible, and estimates should be revisited and revised as more information becomes available.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Use estimates to guide planning, not to set fixed deadlines.\n- Regularly revisit and adjust estimates based on actual progress.\n- Embrace the iterative nature of agile development.\n\n## 9. Neglecting Retrospectives\n\nPost-sprint retrospectives should include a review of estimation accuracy. Analyzing discrepancies between estimates and actual effort helps improve future planning poker sessions.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Incorporate estimation reviews into sprint retrospectives.\n- Identify patterns and common causes of estimation inaccuracies.\n- Use findings to refine the estimation process and training.\n\n## 10. Not Adapting the Process\n\nEvery team is different, and so is every project. Be open to tweaking the planning poker process to better fit your team's needs and dynamics.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Regularly solicit feedback from the team on the planning poker process.\n- Experiment with different approaches and tools to find what works best.\n- Stay informed about best practices and adapt as needed.\n\nBy avoiding these common mistakes, you can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of your planning poker sessions, leading to more predictable and manageable sprints.\n\n\n**Ready to avoid these pitfalls?

Whether you're new to Agile methodologies or a seasoned Scrum Master, understanding and effectively implementing Planning Poker can significantly improve your team's estimation accuracy and overall project success. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know about Planning Poker, from its basic concepts to advanced techniques and best practices.\n\n## 1. Introduction to Planning Poker\n\nPlanning Poker, also known as Scrum Poker, is a consensus-based estimation technique used primarily in Agile software development. It was first described by [James Grenning in 2002](https://wingman-sw.com/papers/PlanningPoker-v1.1.pdf) and later popularized by Mike Cohn in his book [\"Agile Estimating and Planning.\"](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/agile-estimating-and-planning) Learn more about [how different Scrum roles use Planning Poker effectively](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles).\n\nThe primary goal of Planning Poker is to estimate the relative effort or complexity of user stories or tasks within a project. By leveraging the collective wisdom of the team and encouraging discussion, Planning Poker helps create more accurate estimates while fostering collaboration and shared understanding.\n\nThis technique is particularly valuable because it combines expert opinion, team collaboration, and comparative analysis to arrive at estimates. Unlike traditional estimation methods, Planning Poker actively involves all team members, ensuring that different perspectives and areas of expertise are considered.\n\n## 2. How Planning Poker Works\n\nThe Planning Poker process is straightforward but effective. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The Product Owner or facilitator presents a user story or task to the team.\n2. Team members discuss the story, asking questions to clarify requirements and scope.\n3. Each team member privately selects a card representing their estimate.\n4. All team members reveal their cards simultaneously.\n5. If there's a significant discrepancy in estimates, team members discuss their reasoning.\n6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until the team reaches a consensus.\n\nPlanning Poker typically uses a modified Fibonacci sequence for estimation: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100. Some teams also include a '?' card for unknowns and an '∞' card for items that are too large to estimate.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is preferred because it reflects the inherent uncertainty in estimating: as items get larger, the uncertainty increases. The larger gaps between numbers force estimators to make more meaningful distinctions between relative sizes of items.\n\n## 3. Benefits of Using Planning Poker\n\nImplementing Planning Poker in your Agile process offers numerous advantages:\n\n1. **Improved Estimation Accuracy**: By combining multiple perspectives, Planning Poker often leads to more accurate estimates than individual estimations. The collaborative nature of the process allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the task at hand.\n\n2. **Enhanced Team Collaboration**: The process encourages open discussion and knowledge sharing among team members. This not only improves estimates but also builds team cohesion and shared understanding of the project.\n\n3. **Mitigation of Cognitive Biases**: Planning Poker helps reduce common biases such as anchoring, groupthink, and the bandwagon effect. The simultaneous reveal of estimates prevents team members from being unduly influenced by others' opinions.\n\n4. **Increased Engagement**: Team members feel more involved in the estimation process, leading to higher buy-in and commitment. This sense of ownership can translate into increased motivation during project execution.\n\n5. **Better Understanding of Requirements**: Discussions during Planning Poker often uncover hidden complexities or assumptions in user stories. This leads to more refined and well-understood requirements before work begins.\n\n6. **Improved Communication**: The technique fosters better communication between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. It provides a structured format for discussing project details and potential challenges.\n\n## 4. Common Variations of Planning Poker\n\nWhile the modified Fibonacci sequence is the most common, several variations of Planning Poker exist:\n\n1. **Traditional Fibonacci Sequence**: Some teams prefer using the standard Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.). This provides a more granular scale for smaller items but can become unwieldy for larger estimates.\n\n2. **T-Shirt Sizes**: This method uses sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL for estimation, which can be easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand. It's particularly useful for high-level, initial estimates or when working with business teams unfamiliar with story points.\n\n3. **Powers of 2**: Using 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., can be useful for teams that prefer a wider range of options. This scale provides a clear distinction between each level and can be helpful for teams dealing with a broad range of task sizes.\n\n4. **Three-Point Estimation**: This variation involves estimating best-case, worst-case, and most likely scenarios for each item. It provides a more nuanced view of the potential effort involved and can be particularly useful for tasks with high uncertainty.\n\n5. **Custom Scales**: Some teams create their own scales based on their specific needs. For example, a scale of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100 combines elements of Fibonacci and powers of 2.\n\n## 5. Tools and Software for Planning Poker\n\nWhile Planning Poker can be conducted with physical cards, many teams, especially those working remotely, opt for digital solutions. Some popular tools include:\n\n1. [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live): A web-based tool that integrates with popular project management and video conferencing platforms.

Best Practices for Effective Planning Poker Sessions\n\nTo get the most out of your Planning Poker sessions, consider these best practices:\n\n1. **Prepare Adequately**: Ensure all stories are well-defined and that the Product Owner is ready to clarify any questions. Send out the list of items to be estimated in advance, allowing team members to familiarize themselves with the stories.\n\n2. **Set Clear Ground Rules**: Establish guidelines for discussion, time limits, and how consensus will be determined. For example, you might decide that if estimates are within two adjacent cards, you'll use the higher estimate without further discussion.\n\n3. **Encourage Participation**: Make sure all team members feel comfortable sharing their opinions and asking questions. Create an environment where everyone's input is valued, regardless of their role or experience level.\n\n4. **Focus on Relative Sizing**: Emphasize that estimates are relative to each other, not absolute time predictions. Encourage team members to think in terms of complexity and effort rather than hours or days.\n\n5. **Use Reference Stories**: Keep a few well-understood stories as benchmarks for comparison. These reference stories can help calibrate estimates across different sessions and team members.\n\n6. **Timebox Discussions**: Prevent prolonged debates by setting time limits for each round of estimation. A common practice is to limit initial discussions to 2-3 minutes per item.\n\n7. **Document Assumptions**: Record any assumptions or clarifications made during the session for future reference. This can be invaluable when revisiting estimates or during sprint planning.\n\n8. **Rotate the Facilitator**: Consider rotating the role of facilitator among team members. This helps maintain engagement and provides different perspectives on how to run the session.\n\n9. **Review and Adapt**: Regularly review the effectiveness of your Planning Poker sessions and be willing to adapt your process. What works for one team may not work for another.\n\n## 7. Planning Poker for Remote Teams\n\nWith the rise of distributed teams, conducting effective Planning Poker sessions remotely has become increasingly important. Here are some tips for virtual Planning Poker:\n\n1. **Use Video Conferencing**: Seeing team members' faces can improve communication and engagement. Tools like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), or [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) can facilitate face-to-face interactions.\n\n2. **Leverage Digital Tools**: Utilize online Planning Poker platforms that integrate with your video conferencing software. This reduces the friction of estimating, as the Planning Poker session will be visible within the video conferencing app.\n\n3. **Establish Clear Communication Protocols**: Define how team members should indicate they want to speak or ask questions. This could be through a chat function, a raised hand feature, or a agreed-upon verbal cue.\n\n4. **Use Screen Sharing**: Share the backlog or user stories on screen to keep everyone focused. This ensures all team members are looking at the same information during discussions.\n\n5. **Consider Asynchronous Estimation**: For teams across multiple time zones, consider using tools that allow for asynchronous voting and discussion. This can be particularly useful for initial rounds of estimation.\n\n6. **Encourage Active Participation**: In a remote setting, it's easier for some team members to become passive observers. Actively encourage participation from all team members, perhaps by doing a round-robin for initial thoughts on each item.\n\n7. **Use Breakout Rooms**: For larger teams, consider using breakout rooms for smaller group discussions before bringing everyone back together for final estimation.\n\n8. **Have a Dedicated Facilitator**: In remote sessions, a skilled facilitator becomes even more important to keep the session on track, manage time, and ensure all voices are heard.\n\n## 8. Integrating Planning Poker with Other Agile Practices\n\nPlanning Poker doesn't exist in isolation. It's most effective when integrated with other Agile practices:\n\n1. **Sprint Planning**: Use Planning Poker to estimate items for the upcoming sprint, helping to determine sprint capacity. The estimates can inform decisions about which items to include in the sprint backlog.\n\n2. **Backlog Refinement**: Incorporate Planning Poker into regular backlog grooming sessions to keep estimates up-to-date. This ensures that the product backlog is always prioritized and estimated, facilitating smoother sprint planning.\n\n3. **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights from Planning Poker sessions to inform retrospectives and improve future estimations. Analyze the accuracy of past estimates to refine your estimation process over time.\n\n4. **Release Planning**: Leverage estimates from Planning Poker to help forecast release dates and plan product roadmaps. While individual sprint estimates may vary, the aggregate of these estimates can provide valuable insights for longer-term planning.\n\n5. **Team Onboarding**: Use Planning Poker as a tool to help new team members understand the project and the team's estimation process. It can be a great way to get new members engaged and contributing quickly.\n\n6. **Cross-team Calibration**: For organizations with multiple teams working on related projects, Planning Poker can be used as a calibration tool to ensure consistency in estimation across teams.\n\n## 9. Measuring the Success of Planning Poker\n\nTo ensure your Planning Poker sessions are effective, consider tracking these metrics:\n\n1. **Estimation Accuracy**: Compare estimated story points to actual effort expended. This can be done by tracking the number of story points completed in each sprint versus the number planned.\n\n2. **Sprint Velocity Consistency**: Monitor how consistent your team's velocity is from sprint to sprint. While some variation is normal, wild fluctuations might indicate issues with the estimation process.\n\n3. **Time Spent on Estimation**: Track how long your Planning Poker sessions take and aim to optimize efficiency. Long sessions might indicate a need to refine the process or improve story preparation.\n\n4. **Team Satisfaction**: Regularly gather feedback from team members about the estimation process. This could be done through surveys or as part of sprint retrospectives.\n\n5. **Number of Estimation Rounds**: Keep track of how many rounds of voting it typically takes to reach consensus. A high number might indicate a need for better story preparation or more effective facilitation.\n\n6. **Correlation Between Estimates and Business Value**: Over time, analyze whether higher point estimates correlate with higher business value delivery. This can help in prioritizing the product backlog.\n\nRemember, the goal is continuous improvement. Use these metrics to identify areas for refinement in your Planning Poker process, always keeping in mind that the ultimate aim is to deliver value to the customer more effectively.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPlanning Poker is more than just a estimation technique; it's a powerful tool for fostering collaboration, improving project predictability, and enhancing team dynamics. By understanding its principles, following best practices, and continually refining your approach, you can leverage Planning Poker to drive success in your Agile projects.\n\nRemember, the key to effective Planning Poker lies not just in the technique itself, but in how well your team embraces its collaborative spirit. Encourage open discussion, value diverse perspectives, and always strive for continuous improvement. With practice and persistence, Planning Poker can become an invaluable asset in your Agile toolkit.\n\nWhether you're just starting with Planning Poker or looking to optimize your existing process, the principles and practices outlined in this guide will help you and your team estimate more accurately, collaborate more effectively, and ultimately deliver better results."},{"title":"How to Use Planning Poker in Google Meet - A Step-by-Step Installation Guide for Scrum Teams","description":"Learn how to install and use PlanningPoker.live in Google Meet to run effective scrum poker sessions.

Learn the differences and boost your agile team's efficiency with this lighthearted guide.","slug":"commonly-misused-terms-planning-poker","lastUpdated":"2024/10/09","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"planning-poker-misused-terms","coverImageAlt":"Word cloud around Planning Poker","category":"other","tags":["Planning Poker Terms","Agile Estimation","Scrum Poker","Backlog Refinement","Agile Techniques"],"content":"\nIf you've ever stumbled across terms like \"poker planning\" or \"backlog refinement poker\" and wondered, \"Are these just creative variations of Planning Poker, or am I missing out on a new agile technique?\" — you're not alone!\n\nPlanning Poker, also known as **Scrum Poker** or **Agile Poker**, is one of those techniques with many names (and misspellings!). Whether you're a seasoned Scrum Master or new to the world of agile, understanding these terms can be useful. In this post, we'll break down these often misused and misspelled terms so you know exactly what they mean and why they all point back to the same technique.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **1. PlanningPoker (aka Planning Poker)**\n\nLet's start with the classic! **PlanningPoker** (sometimes spelled as a single word, \"planningpoker\") is a consensus-based estimation technique used primarily in Scrum and Agile development. The team gathers to estimate the effort required to complete tasks using a deck of cards, with each card representing an estimate of the task's size or complexity. Learn more about [how different Scrum roles use Planning Poker effectively](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles).\n\n*Need a refresher on how PlanningPoker works? Check out our [comprehensive guide to Planning Poker](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/planning-poker-guide-agile-estimation-techniques).*\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **2. Poker Planning**\n\nAt first glance, **poker planning** sounds like it might be a new form of card game strategy, but don't be fooled! It's just a flip of words that refers to the exact same thing: Planning Poker. If you're seeing \"poker planning\" in an agile context, rest assured — it's still the same team-based estimation game. Learn more about [how to improve sprint planning with Planning Poker](/knowledge-base/how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning).\n\nWe've got more on how to avoid common pitfalls when using the Planning Poker technique in our [blog post](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/common-mistakes-planning-poker).\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **3. Scrum Poker**\n\n**Scrum Poker** is simply another name for Planning Poker, often used when teams want to emphasize the technique's connection to the **Scrum** framework. In Scrum, estimating the size of backlog items is a key part of the sprint planning process. And since Planning Poker is one of the most popular methods for doing that, the name **Scrum Poker** came into use.\n\nNeed help running a Scrum planning session? We've got you covered with our [guide of the top tools for SCRUM Masters](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/essential-scrum-master-tools).\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **4. Agile Poker**\n\nMuch like Scrum Poker, **Agile Poker** is just a variation in name. Teams outside of Scrum, following broader agile methodologies, often use this term. Whether you're following Kanban, Lean, or XP, **Agile Poker** fits right in. Check out our [comparison of different estimation techniques](/knowledge-base/comparing-agile-estimation-techniques) to learn more about how these methodologies approach estimation.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **5. Backlog Refinement Poker**\n\nNow, this term, **Backlog Refinement Poker**, gives a clue about when teams use Planning Poker. During backlog refinement sessions, teams go through the backlog of tasks and estimate their size. Playing Planning Poker at this stage helps ensure everyone is on the same page about the effort needed before tasks enter a sprint.\n\nNeed to know more about backlog refinement and how to make it more effective? Check out our post on [integrating JIRA with Planning Poker](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/how-to-estimate-jira-issues-with-planning-poker).\n\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n    <video alt=\"PlanningPoker.live integrates with Jira and Linear\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtvhnllmc/video/upload/v1682358351/Jira_Optimized_2_tugns9.mp4\" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>\n    <p>Connect your Jira or Linear account in tools like PlanningPoker.live</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **6. Pocker Planning**\n\nAh yes, the classic typo: **Pocker Planning**! If you've ever typed \"pocker\" instead of \"poker,\" you're not alone. But rest assured, **Pocker Planning** is still Planning Poker with an extra dash of creativity (or a finger slip). While the typo is common, it's always fun to see how even small mistakes can give familiar terms a whole new vibe.\n\nFor a typo-free overview of how to make your next sprint planning session a success, head over to our [guide to all roles in a Planning Poker session](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles).\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **7. Sprint Poker**\n\nMuch like \"Scrum Poker,\" **Sprint Poker** refers to using Planning Poker during a sprint planning meeting. This term emphasizes the technique's use during the sprint phase of agile development, which is when tasks are estimated and prioritized. It's especially useful if you want to rank for sprint-related keywords.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **8. Estimation Poker**\n\nSome teams refer to Planning Poker as **Estimation Poker** to focus on its core purpose: task estimation. This variation highlights the fact that the primary goal of the technique is to assign effort values to tasks, making it applicable to different stages of the agile workflow, not just sprint planning.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **9. Fibonacci Poker**\n\nOccasionally, you might hear **Fibonacci Poker** mentioned. This term arises because Planning Poker often uses Fibonacci sequence numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) for estimates. The Fibonacci sequence helps teams keep estimates reasonable and avoids over-complicating task sizing.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **10. Story Point Poker**\n\nSometimes referred to as **Story Point Poker**, this term zeroes in on the story point estimation system often used with Planning Poker. Story points are a popular unit for measuring the effort required for backlog items in agile teams.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n### So, What's the Difference?\n\nIn the end, whether you call it **PlanningPoker**, **Poker Planning**, **Scrum Poker**, or even **Pocker Planning**, they all refer to the same technique: a fun, collaborative way to estimate effort and complexity in Agile teams. While the names may differ, the core process remains the same.\n\nSo, next time you see these terms thrown around, feel free to jump into the conversation knowing that you're all talking about the same thing — even if the spelling is a little off.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\nIf you're ready to use Planning Poker in your next sprint, why not try it out in [Microsoft Teams](https://planningpoker.live/integrations/teams), [Google Meet](https://planningpoker.live/integrations/meet) or explore the [PlanningPoker.live app](https://planningpoker.live/) to integrate it directly into your remote meetings?\n\nHappy estimating!\n"},{"title":"How to Run a Planning Poker Session with PlanningPoker.live","description":"Learn how to run a smooth Agile estimation session using PlanningPoker.live.

Inconsistent or unclear estimates can slow down sprint planning, disrupt workflows, and lead to frustration. That's why **PlanningPoker.live** offers flexible card sets to ensure your estimation sessions are as effective as possible.\n\nIn this guide, we'll walk you through how to manage your cards, switch between different sets, enable useful options like \"Pass,\" and create your own custom decks tailored to your team's needs. Let's get started!\n\n\n### **1. Managing Your Cards and Reaction Emojis**\n\nWhen you enter a PlanningPoker.live session, your estimation cards are displayed on a floating panel at the bottom of the screen. This layout is designed for maximum visibility while keeping the interface uncluttered. However, depending on the complexity of your sprint planning or the size of your team, you may want more flexibility.\n\nThe **Cards button** lets you hide or show your card deck with a single click. This is particularly useful if you're sharing your screen or need to focus on the discussion without distractions. Similarly, your **reaction emojis** — small icons that let you provide quick feedback or express agreement — are displayed above the cards. You can hide or show these emojis on demand to keep the interface streamlined.\n\nBy customizing the visibility of your cards and emojis, you can create a cleaner, distraction-free environment for your team to focus on the conversation. This flexibility helps ensure that everyone stays engaged, especially during longer planning sessions.\n\n\n### **2. Switching Between Different Card Sets for Better Estimates**\n\nNot all estimation tasks are the same, and using the right card set can make a big difference. For example, estimating a straightforward task might be best with a simple numeric scale, while more complex tasks benefit from broader categories like T-shirt sizes. Check out our [comparison of different estimation techniques](/knowledge-base/comparing-agile-estimation-techniques) to learn more about which approach might work best for your team.\n\nTo change your card set:\n\n1. Click **Room Settings** and select **Set Cards**.  \n2. Choose from a range of built-in presets that cater to common estimation practices:  \n    - **Fibonacci Sequence** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) is popular for estimating tasks with varying levels of complexity.  \n    - **T-shirt Sizing** (XS, S, M, L, XL) works well for tasks that don't require precise numerical estimates.  \n    - **Sequential Numbers** (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are ideal for quick, linear estimations.  \n\nDifferent card sets help your team avoid overthinking and instead focus on relative estimation. For instance, Fibonacci cards encourage teams to think in terms of magnitude rather than exact figures, which can simplify discussions about effort and complexity.\n\nExperiment with different presets to find what resonates most with your team. Sometimes switching card sets between sprints or for different types of tasks can refresh your team's perspective and improve overall estimation accuracy.\n\n\n### **3. The \"Pass\" Option: Supporting Better Collaboration**\n\nSometimes, during an estimation session, a team member might not have enough information to provide a reliable estimate. Instead of making a guess or holding up the team, it's helpful to have a way to gracefully opt out. That's where the **Pass** option comes in.\n\nIn the **Set Cards** menu, you can toggle the **Pass option** to add a \"Pass\" card to your deck. This gives participants the ability to skip estimating a specific task without feeling pressured to provide a number or category. The \"Pass\" option promotes transparency and trust by encouraging team members to admit when they need more clarity.\n\nBy allowing for uncertainty, you can avoid misleading estimates and ensure that discussions remain honest and productive. After someone passes, you can revisit the task later with additional context or break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This approach leads to more accurate planning and a healthier team dynamic.\n\n\n### **4. Creating Custom Card Decks for Unique Workflows**\n\nWhile the default presets cover many estimation needs, some teams have unique workflows or estimation practices that require something more specific. **PlanningPoker.live** allows you to create fully customizable card decks that align perfectly with your team's needs.\n\nHere's how to create a custom deck:\n\n1. Navigate to **Room Settings** > **Set Cards**.  \n2. Select the **Custom Deck** option.  \n3. Enter your own values, which can be numeric (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100) or non-numeric (e.g., \"Quick Fix,\" \"Needs Research,\" \"Too Big\").  \n\nCustom decks are especially useful for specialized teams or projects that don't fit neatly into traditional estimation models. For example:\n\n- **Design teams** might use cards like \"Sketch,\" \"Prototype,\" and \"Final Design.\"  \n- **DevOps teams** might prefer terms like \"Minor,\" \"Major,\" and \"Critical.\"  \n\nThe best part? Your custom decks are automatically saved to the **Cloud**, so you can easily access and reuse them in future sessions. This means you don't have to rebuild your decks each time, saving your team valuable time and effort.\n\n\n### **Why Flexible Card Sets Matter**\n\nFlexible card sets give your team the freedom to estimate in a way that makes sense for the task at hand. By switching between presets, enabling the \"Pass\" option, and creating custom decks, you can ensure that your estimation process is both efficient and accurate.

AI can feel like “one more thing to learn,” but used well it becomes a quiet assistant that prepares, tidies, and summarises in the background so you can focus on people instead of admin.\n\nThis article focuses on how AI can *practically* help Scrum Masters in 2025—no heavy jargon and no need to write code. We will look at a few simple types of tools, what they do for you day to day, and how they can support practices you may already use, like Planning Poker. If you want to go deeper on estimation itself, check out our [Agile estimation guide](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-guide-agile-estimation-techniques) and the article on [common Planning Poker mistakes](/knowledge-base/common-mistakes-planning-poker).\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## Why Scrum Masters need AI backup\n\n- **You are in meetings all day.** Capturing every action, decision, and risk by hand is almost impossible.  \n- **Work changes faster than plans.** With AI-assisted coding and “let’s just try this” vibe sessions, new tasks appear constantly.  \n- **Everyone wants updates.** Developers, product owners, and managers all ask, “Are we on track?”—often in different formats.\n\nAI can’t coach people or resolve conflict for you. But it can quietly prepare notes, tidy backlogs, and pull together updates so you have more time and energy for the human side of the job.\n\n## Five simple ways AI can support Scrum Masters\n\nYou do not need a huge “AI stack” to get value. Think in terms of a few simple helpers that plug into the tools you already use.\n\n### 1. Keeping the backlog in shape\n\nBacklog-focused AI tools read through your issues or user stories and help you get them ready for the team. They can:\n\n- Spot duplicate or very similar tickets.  \n- Suggest clearer wording or acceptance criteria.  \n- List questions you might want to ask the product owner.\n\nBefore backlog refinement, you can ask an AI assistant to “review the top 10 items and highlight anything unclear.” You walk into the meeting with a shorter, sharper list and better questions.\n\n**Tool examples:**  \n- Jira Software with Atlassian Intelligence – helps rewrite descriptions, spot duplicates, and suggest fields: <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>  \n- Linear with AI features – suggests clearer issue titles and groups related work: <https://linear.app/>  \n- Azure Boards with GitHub Copilot Chat – lets you ask natural-language questions about work items: <https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops>\n\n### 2. Taking notes so you can facilitate\n\nIn standups, reviews, or retros, it is hard to be a great facilitator *and* write down everything. Meeting assistants can listen in (for example, in your video call) and:\n\n- Capture key decisions and action items.  \n- Group comments into themes (e.g. “testing delays,” “unclear priorities”).  \n- Send a short summary to your team channel right after the call.\n\nYou remain in control of the conversation, but you do not lose important details when the next meeting starts five minutes later.\n\n**Tool examples:**  \n- Otter.ai – records meetings and produces searchable notes and action items: <https://otter.ai>  \n- Fireflies.ai – joins calls, transcribes discussion, and sends summaries to tools like Slack: <https://fireflies.ai>  \n- Zoom AI Companion – built-in summaries and highlights if your team already uses Zoom: <https://explore.zoom.us/en/products/ai-companion/>\n\n### 3. Making estimation and Planning Poker smoother\n\nPlanning Poker should stay a human conversation, but AI can help you prepare and keep it focused:\n\n- Summarise the history of a story (comments, changes, related bugs) into a few lines everyone can read before voting.  \n- Remind the team of similar stories you estimated in the past so you do not start from zero each time.  \n- Highlight obvious risks (“touches an unfamiliar system,” “depends on another team”) so people feel safe putting higher cards on the table.\n\nUse these insights as talking points, not as “the answer.” That keeps Planning Poker aligned with the best practices in our article on [improving sprint planning with Planning Poker](/knowledge-base/how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning).\n\n**Tool examples:**  \n- ChatGPT or similar assistants – summarise story comments and related bugs before the session: <https://chat.openai.com>  \n- Notion AI – turn scattered notes into a short brief you can share with the team: <https://www.notion.so/product/ai>  \n- PlanningPoker.live – run the actual Planning Poker session online once everyone has read the AI-prepared context: <https://planningpoker.live>\n\n### 4. Watching team health between meetings\n\nMany Scrum Masters spend time pulling charts from different tools and trying to understand what is really going on. AI helpers can:\n\n- Point out simple patterns like “a lot of work is started but not finished” or “unplanned work is eating into sprint goals.”  \n- Turn a pile of metrics into a plain-language explanation you can share with the team.  \n- Suggest questions for the next retro based on what changed.\n\nYou get a clearer picture quicker, and you can turn that into coaching instead of more spreadsheet work.\n\n**Tool examples:**  \n- Jira dashboards with Atlassian Intelligence – ask questions like “which issues are most often blocked?” in plain language: <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>  \n- Swarmia – connects to your repos and boards to highlight flow problems and focus areas: <https://www.swarmia.com>  \n- Linear Insights – shows trends across cycles and flags work that keeps rolling over: <https://linear.app/>\n\n### 5. Helping you talk to stakeholders\n\nWriting clear updates for managers and customers is part of the job, but it is time-consuming. AI writing assistants can turn your notes into:\n\n- A short sprint summary for leadership.  \n- A longer update for your product or customer community.  \n- A few bullet points you can paste into an email or chat message.\n\nYou still decide what to say and what tone matches your organisation. The AI simply helps with structure and wording so you can communicate more often with less effort.\n\n**Tool examples:**  \n- GrammarlyGO – helps you turn rough notes into clear, polished messages: <https://www.grammarly.com/grammarlygo>  \n- Notion AI – generates internal updates or documentation drafts from your bullet points: <https://www.notion.so/product/ai>  \n- Microsoft 365 Copilot – assists with summarising sprints and writing status updates inside Outlook or Word: <https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot>\n\n## Choosing AI tools without getting overwhelmed\n\n1. **Start from a single pain point.** Pick one area that drains your energy the most—maybe it is note-taking or preparing refinements—and look for a tool that helps *just* there.  \n2. **Try it with a small group.** Pilot AI helpers with one team or one ceremony before rolling them out wider.  \n3. **Keep the team informed.** Explain what the tool does, what data it sees, and how summaries will be used. Invite feedback early.  \n4. **Review the output together.** In the first few weeks, quickly scan AI summaries or suggestions with the team so everyone builds trust (or raises concerns) together.  \n5. **Measure with simple signals.** Ask: “Are our meetings shorter?”, “Do we forget fewer actions?”, “Do stakeholders feel better informed?” If the answer is no, change or drop the tool.\n\n## Sample AI-enhanced workflow for a Scrum Master\n\n1. **Before backlog refinement:** An AI assistant reviews upcoming items and suggests which ones need clearer descriptions or extra details.  \n2. **During Planning Poker:** You bring in a short AI-generated summary of the story history and any similar work you did before, then let the team vote and discuss.  \n3. **After daily standup:** A meeting bot posts a short note with yesterday’s progress, today’s plans, and any blockers, so nothing is forgotten.  \n4. **Mid-sprint check-in:** You ask an AI helper to explain, in simple language, what changed compared with the last sprint and whether goals still look realistic.  \n5. **Sprint review prep:** A writing assistant turns your list of completed stories into a clear update for stakeholders and a quick highlight reel for the team.\n\nUsed together, these small helpers give you back time and mental space so you can focus on coaching, conflict resolution, and protecting the team.\n\n## Responsible adoption checklist\n\n- **Transparency:** Tell the team what data the AI sees and how summaries are used.  \n- **Bias awareness:** Review AI-generated insights for unfair assumptions, especially around performance.  \n- **Human approval:** Keep a person in the loop for estimations, status updates, and retro actions.  \n- **Continuous improvement:** Treat AI tools like experiments—inspect and adapt during retros just like any other practice.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAI will not run your Scrum events or replace your judgment—and it should not try to. But it can quietly handle the repetitive, text-heavy parts of the role: tidying backlogs, taking notes, spotting simple patterns, and shaping updates. Start small, with one helper in one area, and grow from there. The goal is simple: more time with your team, less time wrestling with tools.\n"},{"title":"Top 7 Benefits of Planning Poker - Why Your Agile Team Needs It","description":"Discover how Planning Poker enhances Agile estimation, improves collaboration, eliminates bias, and streamlines sprint planning.

Many Scrum teams out there struggle with estimating effort that leads to: missed deadlines, overworked developers, and frustrated stakeholders.\n\n\nWithout a structured approach, estimations often become a guessing game dominated by the loudest voices in the room.\n\nEnter Planning Poker, a simple yet powerful [Agile estimation technique](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-guide-agile-estimation-techniques) that helps teams reach accurate estimates collaboratively and efficiently. By leveraging a consensus-based approach, Planning Poker ensures that every team member has a say, reducing bias and improving the overall accuracy of estimates.  \n\nIn this article, we'll dive into the top 7 benefits of Planning Poker and why your Agile team should adopt it for better backlog refinement, sprint planning, and project success. Let's get started!  \n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>  \n\n## **1. Improves Estimation Accuracy**  \n\nOne of the biggest challenges in Agile project management is creating accurate estimates. Poor estimates can lead to unrealistic commitments, missed deadlines, and scope creep. Planning Poker helps eliminate these risks by improving estimation accuracy.\n\n### How does Planning Poker improve accuracy?  \n- **Consensus-based approach:** Instead of relying on a single estimate, the team collectively agrees on a value.  \n- **Prevents anchoring bias:** Since team members reveal their estimates simultaneously, no one is influenced by others' opinions beforehand.  \n- **Encourages discussion:** If there are major discrepancies in estimates, teams discuss their reasoning, leading to a more refined and accurate estimate. Learn more about [avoiding common estimation mistakes](/knowledge-base/common-mistakes-planning-poker).  \n\nBy leveraging diverse perspectives and structured discussions, teams arrive at more reliable estimates, making sprint planning and resource allocation much more effective.\n\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img alt=\"Missed deadlines cause frustration\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtvhnllmc/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_1000,q_70/v1711188812/shovel_blog.png\">\n</div>\n\n## **2. Encourages Team Collaboration**\n\nCollaboration is at the heart of Agile, and Planning Poker fosters a team-oriented approach to estimation. Instead of a single person dictating story points, the entire team engages in the estimation process, ensuring collective buy-in and better decision-making.\n\n### How does Planning Poker boost collaboration?\n\n- **Encourages equal participation:** Every team member contributes their own estimation before discussing the differences, ensuring that [junior members and quieter individuals](/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles) have a voice.\n\n- **Promotes shared understanding:** Since discussions emerge from differing estimates, the team collectively refines their understanding of the user stories before committing to an estimate.\n\n- **Prevents knowledge silos:** By involving the entire team in estimation discussions, knowledge is shared across developers, testers, and product owners, leading to **better alignment and fewer misunderstandings** during development.\n\nWhen teams collaborate effectively, their estimates become more informed, sprint planning becomes more accurate, and overall productivity improves.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **3. Eliminates HiPPO Influence (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)**\n\nIn traditional estimation meetings, the loudest or most senior voice in the room often dictates the final estimate. This is known as HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) bias, which can lead to unrealistic commitments and overlooked complexities.\n\n### How does Planning Poker remove HiPPO bias?\n\n- **Simultaneous estimation:** All participants reveal their estimates at the same time, preventing the team from being influenced by the highest-ranking individual's opinion.\n\n- **Equal weighting of opinions:** Since every team member participates, junior developers and testers can challenge assumptions made by senior members, leading to more balanced and **realistic** estimates.\n\n- **Focuses on discussion, not hierarchy:** If a wide variance in estimates exists, the conversation focuses on why, rather than deferring to the opinion of a single authority figure. This ensures better risk assessment and more thoughtful planning.\n\nBy reducing HiPPO bias, Planning Poker ensures that decisions are driven by data and team consensus, rather than seniority or persuasion tactics.\n\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img alt=\"Pros and cons of Planning Poker\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtvhnllmc/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_1000,q_70/v1711188812/benefits_pros_cons_blog.png\">\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **4. Makes Backlog Refinement More Effective**\n\nEffective backlog refinement is essential for a smooth sprint planning process. Planning Poker helps teams identify unclear requirements, missing details, and overly complex user stories before they become bottlenecks.\n\n### How does Planning Poker improve backlog refinement?\n\n- **Detects ambiguities early:** Through discussions during estimation, teams can spot vague or incomplete user stories, prompting the Product Owner to clarify or refine them before development begins.\n\n- **Ensures stories are well-defined:** If a story receives a wide range of estimates, it often signals the need for further clarification or breakdown into smaller tasks.\n\n- **Reduces surprises during sprint planning:** By refining stories ahead of time, teams ensure that sprint planning sessions run efficiently without last-minute discussions on scope or feasibility.\n\nBy integrating Planning Poker into backlog refinement, Agile teams create a more structured and transparent workflow, leading to higher development efficiency and fewer roadblocks.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **5. Engages Remote and Distributed Teams**\n\nWith the rise of remote work, Agile teams often struggle to maintain collaboration and engagement during estimation meetings. Planning Poker provides a structured and interactive way for distributed teams to stay involved and contribute effectively.\n\n### How does Planning Poker enhance remote teamwork?\n\n- **Works seamlessly with digital tools:** Online Planning Poker platforms integrate with collaboration tools like [Google Meet](/knowledge-base/how-to-use-planning-poker-in-google-meet), [Microsoft Teams](/knowledge-base/installing-planning-poker-microsoft-teams-guide), and [Jira](/knowledge-base/how-to-estimate-jira-issues-with-planning-poker), making remote estimations more interactive and efficient.\n\n- **Increases engagement in virtual meetings:** Traditional estimation meetings can be dominated by a few voices, but Planning Poker ensures that everyone contributes. Check out our guide on [advanced strategies for remote teams](/knowledge-base/advanced-strategies-planning-poker-remote-teams).\n\n- **Facilitates asynchronous estimation:** Teams working across different time zones can estimate asynchronously, allowing members to contribute at their convenience without delaying the sprint planning process.\n\nBy providing a structured approach to remote estimations, Planning Poker ensures that distributed teams remain aligned, engaged, and efficient.\n\n\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img alt=\"PlanningPoker.live open in the Activities sidebar\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtvhnllmc/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_1000,q_70/v1711188812/Meet-landing.png\">\n    <p>PlanningPoker.live started in Google Meet</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **6. Reduces Over- or Underestimation Risks**\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in Agile estimation is striking the right balance between over- and underestimating effort. Planning Poker helps teams find a realistic middle ground, preventing both overly optimistic and overly cautious estimates.\n\n### How does Planning Poker minimize estimation risks?\n\n- **Prevents overestimation:** Teams that overestimate effort may take longer to deliver than necessary. Planning Poker fosters discussion, allowing the team to challenge and refine estimates to avoid excessive padding.\n\n- **Avoids underestimation:** Unrealistic low estimates can lead to overworked teams and technical debt. By using consensus-driven estimation, Planning Poker ensures that hidden complexities are addressed before development starts.\n\n- **Balances workload effectively:** With more accurate estimates, teams can commit to a realistic amount of work per sprint, reducing burnout and improving predictability.\n\nBy eliminating extreme estimates and promoting well-informed discussions, Planning Poker enhances sprint planning accuracy and project stability.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **7. Speeds Up Sprint Planning**\n\nTraditional sprint planning sessions can drag on when teams struggle to agree on story points. Planning Poker streamlines this process, allowing teams to reach consensus quickly and move forward with execution.\n\n### How does Planning Poker make sprint planning faster?\n\n- **Reduces unnecessary debate:** Since estimates are provided simultaneously, teams avoid prolonged discussions about individual opinions and focus on outlier estimates instead.\n\n- **Ensures preparedness:** By refining estimates in advance, sprint planning meetings are more efficient, focusing on execution rather than lengthy estimations.\n\n- **Increases confidence in sprint commitments:** Teams can commit to a sprint backlog with greater confidence, knowing that estimates have been reviewed and agreed upon collaboratively.\n\nWith a streamlined sprint planning process, teams spend less time debating and more time delivering value to stakeholders.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nPlanning Poker is more than just a game, it's a proven Agile estimation technique that enhances collaboration, eliminates bias, and leads to more accurate and efficient planning. By fostering team discussions, engaging remote teams, and reducing estimation risks, Planning Poker helps Agile teams stay aligned and productive.\n\nWant to learn more?
