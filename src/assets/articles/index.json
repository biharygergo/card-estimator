It is a fun and engaging way for teams to apply relative estimates to planned work. Planning Poker can be used to improve Sprint Planning meetings and deliver more value to customers.\n\nThe three Scrum roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers, all play a role in using Planning Poker effectively.\n\n### The Product Owner\n\nThe Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, which is a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done to develop the product. The Product Owner also works with the team to estimate the effort required for each Product Backlog Item (PBI).\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Product Owner is responsible for:\n\n- Reading the PBI aloud to the team\n- Answering any questions that the team has about the PBI\n- Helping the team to reach a consensus on the estimate for the PBI\n\n### The Scrum Master\n\nThe Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team to follow the Scrum framework. The Scrum Master also helps the team to remove any impediments that are preventing them from delivering value to customers.\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Scrum Master is responsible for:\n\n- Facilitating the session and keeping it on track\n- Ensuring that everyone on the team is participating and that their voice is heard\n- Helping the team to resolve any conflicts or disagreements\n\n### The Developers\n\nThe Developers are responsible for delivering the work in the Sprint Backlog. They are also responsible for estimating the effort required for each PBI.\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Developers are responsible for:\n\n- Selecting a Planning Poker card that represents their estimate of the effort required for the PBI\n- Discussing their estimates with the team and trying to reach a consensus\n- Providing feedback on the estimates of other team members\n\n## How the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively\n\nThe Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively by:\n\n- **Communicating effectively.** It is important for all three roles to communicate effectively during a Planning Poker session. The Product Owner needs to be able to clearly explain the PBI, the Scrum Master needs to be able to facilitate the discussion, and the Developers need to be able to share their estimates and feedback.\n- **Trusting each other.** It is also important for all three roles to trust each other. The Product Owner needs to trust the Developers to provide accurate estimates, and the Scrum Master needs to trust the Product Owner and Developers to work together to reach a consensus.\n- **Being open to feedback.** Everyone on the team should be open to feedback from the other team members. This will help to ensure that the estimates are accurate and that the team is on the same page.\n\nBy following these tips, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively and improve their team's velocity.\n\n**Additional tips for using Planning Poker effectively:**\n\n- Use a Fibonacci sequence to estimate effort. This will help to avoid estimating in whole numbers and to make more accurate estimates.\n- Be honest with your estimates. Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" or to change your estimate if you hear new information.\n- Have fun! Planning Poker should be a fun and collaborative experience. Don't take it too seriously.\n- Use an online tool for estimating, as it makes things easier to track and more enjoyable. Give [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live) a try!\n\nBy using Planning Poker effectively, you can improve your team's velocity and deliver more value to your customers.\n"},{"title":"Comparing Agile estimation techniques","description":"Agile estimation techniques are essential for helping teams plan their work and set realistic expectations.

Relative estimation is more accurate than absolute estimation. When estimating tasks, compare them to other tasks that you have completed in the past.\n* Be realistic. Don't underestimate or overestimate the effort required to complete tasks. Be realistic and honest with your estimates.\n* Update your estimates regularly. As you learn more about the work, update your estimates accordingly.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAgile estimation techniques are a valuable tool for helping teams plan their work and set realistic expectations. By choosing the right technique for the job and using it effectively, you can improve your team's ability to deliver on its commitments.\n\n## Additional Tips\n\nHere are some additional tips for using agile estimation techniques:\n\n* Use a tool to help you manage your estimates. There are a number of tools available that can help you to track and manage your estimates.\n* Review your estimates regularly. Meet with your team on a regular basis to review your estimates and make sure that they are still accurate.\n* Be flexible. Agile estimation is an iterative process. It is important to be flexible and willing to adjust your estimates as needed.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your team's use of agile estimation techniques and improve your team's ability to plan and deliver on its commitments.\n"},{"title":"How to use Planning Poker to improve your sprint planning meetings","description":"Learn how to use Planning Poker to improve your sprint planning meetings and deliver more value to your customers.","slug":"how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning","lastUpdated":"2023/10/07","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"pexels-fauxels-3184306_vv2kvt","coverImageAlt":"A group of people during a meeting","content":"## What is Planning Poker?\n\nPlanning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort in agile software development. It is a fun and engaging way for teams to apply relative estimates to planned work. Planning Poker can be used to improve sprint planning meetings in a number of ways:\n\n- **It helps to reduce bias and groupthink.** In traditional estimation techniques, the loudest or most influential team members may tend to dominate the discussion and influence the estimates. Planning Poker helps to level the playing field by giving everyone an equal voice.\n- **It encourages collaboration and communication.** Planning Poker is a team exercise that requires everyone to participate and share their thoughts. This helps to foster collaboration and communication within the team.\n- **It leads to more realistic estimates.** Planning Poker estimates are based on the collective knowledge and experience of the team. This makes them more likely to be realistic and achievable than estimates that are made by individuals.\n\n## How to use Planning Poker in your sprint planning meeting\n\n1. **Prepare.** Make sure that everyone on the team has a deck of Planning Poker cards. You can use physical cards or an online tool such as [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live). Using an online tool is a good idea, since it automatically tracks estimates, history and calculates statistics.\n2. **Read the user story.** The Product Owner reads the user story aloud to the team and sets the topic in the app.\n3. **Estimate.** Each team member selects a card from their deck that represents their estimate of the effort required to complete the user story.\n4. **Reveal.** Everyone reveals their cards at the same time. When played online, this step is done by the leader of the meeting.\n5. **Discuss.** If the estimates are widely different, the team discusses the reasons for the differences and tries to reach a consensus.\n6. **Repeat.** Steps 3-5 are repeated until the team reaches a consensus on an estimate for the user story.\n\n## Tips for using Planning Poker effectively\n\n- **Use a Fibonacci sequence.** Planning Poker cards are typically numbered in a Fibonacci sequence, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89. This sequence helps to avoid the tendency to estimate in whole numbers. You can even decide on your own card deck, which is supported by most online tools as well.\n- **Use relative estimates.** Planning Poker estimates are relative to each other, rather than to a specific unit of time. This helps to avoid the problem of overestimating or underestimating complex tasks.\n- **Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know.\"** If you don't have enough information to estimate a user story, it's okay to say so. The goal of Planning Poker is to get a rough estimate of the effort required, not to be precise. When played online, you can add a \"Pass\" card to the deck to represent this vote.\n- **Don't be afraid to change your mind.** If you hear new information during the discussion phase, you can change your estimate. The goal is to reach a consensus on an estimate that everyone is comfortable with.\n\n## Additional tips\n\n- **Start with a small set of user stories.** Don't try to estimate all of the user stories for the Sprint in one sitting. Start with a small set of user stories, and then come back to the rest later.\n- **Take breaks.** Planning Poker can be mentally draining, so it's important to take breaks. Get up and move around, or do something else for a while.\n- **Keep a human connection.** Use Planning Poker in real-life or during a video conference. You can [install an extension](https://planningpoker.live/features) of PlanningPoker.live in your favorite video conferencing tool to see each other during the session.\n- **Have fun!** Planning Poker should be a fun and collaborative experience. Don't take it too seriously.\n\nPlanning Poker is a powerful tool that can help you to improve your sprint planning meetings and deliver more value to your customers. By following the tips above, you can use Planning Poker effectively to estimate the effort required for your Sprint Backlog items.\n"},{"title":"How to estimate JIRA issues with Planning Poker","description":"In this short tutorial you can learn how to set up an integration with JIRA in PlanningPoker.live and estimate tickets with ease","slug":"how-to-estimate-jira-issues-with-planning-poker","lastUpdated":"2023/10/25","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"topics","coverImageAlt":"A graphic showing issues stacked over each other","content":"\n### Introduction\n\nPlanning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort or complexity.

However, several common mistakes can hinder its effectiveness. Here’s a comprehensive guide to avoiding these pitfalls:\n\n## 1. Lack of Preparation\n\nPreparation is crucial for a successful planning poker session. Ensure that the user stories are well-defined and the acceptance criteria are clear. Without this, team members might have different understandings of the story, leading to inaccurate estimates.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Hold grooming sessions beforehand.\n- Ensure stories are broken down to manageable sizes.\n- Clarify any ambiguities in the user stories and acceptance criteria.\n\n## 2. Dominance of Senior Team Members\n\nIn some teams, senior members or more vocal individuals may dominate the discussion, influencing the estimates of others. Encourage all team members to share their views independently before discussing the estimates to avoid this bias.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Use anonymous voting tools to ensure independent input.\n- Facilitate discussions in a way that encourages quieter team members to voice their opinions.\n- Rotate facilitators to prevent dominance by a single individual.\n\n## 3. Underestimating Story Complexity\n\nTeams sometimes overlook the complexity of a user story, leading to underestimation. Discuss potential challenges and dependencies thoroughly before voting to get a more accurate estimate.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Encourage detailed discussions on possible technical challenges and dependencies.\n- Use historical data to inform complexity estimations.\n- Break down complex stories into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n\n## 4. Skipping Discussion on Disparities\n\nWhen there’s a significant difference in estimates, it’s essential to discuss the reasons behind the disparity. This discussion often reveals overlooked details and leads to a more accurate consensus.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Always discuss outliers and the reasoning behind high and low estimates.\n- Use these discussions as learning opportunities for the team.\n- Document insights gained during these discussions for future reference.\n\n## 5. Ignoring Team Capacity\n\nEven if the estimates are accurate, not considering the team’s capacity can derail a sprint. Balance the estimated workload with the team’s available capacity to avoid overcommitment.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Regularly update and track team capacity.\n- Adjust the sprint backlog based on team availability.\n- Consider factors like holidays, vacations, and other commitments.\n\n## 6. Using planning poker for Every Story\n\nWhile planning poker is valuable, it’s not necessary for every user story, especially small or well-understood tasks. Reserve it for complex or high-uncertainty stories to keep sessions efficient.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Categorize stories based on complexity and uncertainty.\n- Use planning poker selectively for high-impact stories.\n- Develop a streamlined estimation process for simpler tasks.\n\n## 7. Infrequent Sessions\n\nHolding planning poker sessions too infrequently can lead to rushed estimations or forgotten context. Regular, scheduled sessions help maintain consistency and accuracy in estimates.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Schedule regular planning poker sessions, ideally at the beginning of each sprint.\n- Ensure that these sessions are prioritized and attended by all relevant team members.\n- Use these sessions to maintain a backlog of estimated stories.\n\n## 8. Over-Reliance on Numbers\n\nTreat planning poker estimates as guidelines rather than exact figures. Agile projects are inherently flexible, and estimates should be revisited and revised as more information becomes available.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Use estimates to guide planning, not to set fixed deadlines.\n- Regularly revisit and adjust estimates based on actual progress.\n- Embrace the iterative nature of agile development.\n\n## 9. Neglecting Retrospectives\n\nPost-sprint retrospectives should include a review of estimation accuracy. Analyzing discrepancies between estimates and actual effort helps improve future planning poker sessions.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n- Incorporate estimation reviews into sprint retrospectives.\n- Identify patterns and common causes of estimation inaccuracies.\n- Use findings to refine the estimation process and training.\n\n## 10.

Learn techniques, benefits, and best practices for accurate story point estimation. Improve your team's productivity with our comprehensive guide to Planning Poker.","slug":"planning-poker-guide-agile-estimation-techniques","lastUpdated":"2024/07/07","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"pexels-fauxels-3183197_k4uned","coverImageAlt":"People in a meeting room","content":"\nPlanning Poker has become an essential tool in the Agile practitioner's toolkit. Whether you're new to Agile methodologies or a seasoned Scrum Master, understanding and effectively implementing Planning Poker can significantly improve your team's estimation accuracy and overall project success. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know about Planning Poker, from its basic concepts to advanced techniques and best practices.\n\n## 1. Introduction to Planning Poker\n\nPlanning Poker, also known as Scrum Poker, is a consensus-based estimation technique used primarily in Agile software development. It was first described by James Grenning in 2002 and later popularized by Mike Cohn in his book \"Agile Estimating and Planning.\"\n\nThe primary goal of Planning Poker is to estimate the relative effort or complexity of user stories or tasks within a project. By leveraging the collective wisdom of the team and encouraging discussion, Planning Poker helps create more accurate estimates while fostering collaboration and shared understanding.\n\nThis technique is particularly valuable because it combines expert opinion, team collaboration, and comparative analysis to arrive at estimates. Unlike traditional estimation methods, Planning Poker actively involves all team members, ensuring that different perspectives and areas of expertise are considered.\n\n## 2. How Planning Poker Works\n\nThe Planning Poker process is straightforward but effective. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The Product Owner or facilitator presents a user story or task to the team.\n2. Team members discuss the story, asking questions to clarify requirements and scope.\n3. Each team member privately selects a card representing their estimate.\n4. All team members reveal their cards simultaneously.\n5. If there's a significant discrepancy in estimates, team members discuss their reasoning.\n6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until the team reaches a consensus.\n\nPlanning Poker typically uses a modified Fibonacci sequence for estimation: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100. Some teams also include a '?' card for unknowns and an '∞' card for items that are too large to estimate.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is preferred because it reflects the inherent uncertainty in estimating: as items get larger, the uncertainty increases. The larger gaps between numbers force estimators to make more meaningful distinctions between relative sizes of items.\n\n## 3. Benefits of Using Planning Poker\n\nImplementing Planning Poker in your Agile process offers numerous advantages:\n\n1. **Improved Estimation Accuracy**: By combining multiple perspectives, Planning Poker often leads to more accurate estimates than individual estimations. The collaborative nature of the process allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the task at hand.\n\n2. **Enhanced Team Collaboration**: The process encourages open discussion and knowledge sharing among team members. This not only improves estimates but also builds team cohesion and shared understanding of the project.\n\n3. **Mitigation of Cognitive Biases**: Planning Poker helps reduce common biases such as anchoring, groupthink, and the bandwagon effect. The simultaneous reveal of estimates prevents team members from being unduly influenced by others' opinions.\n\n4. **Increased Engagement**: Team members feel more involved in the estimation process, leading to higher buy-in and commitment. This sense of ownership can translate into increased motivation during project execution.\n\n5. **Better Understanding of Requirements**: Discussions during Planning Poker often uncover hidden complexities or assumptions in user stories. This leads to more refined and well-understood requirements before work begins.\n\n6. **Improved Communication**: The technique fosters better communication between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. It provides a structured format for discussing project details and potential challenges.\n\n## 4. Common Variations of Planning Poker\n\nWhile the modified Fibonacci sequence is the most common, several variations of Planning Poker exist:\n\n1. **Traditional Fibonacci Sequence**: Some teams prefer using the standard Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.). This provides a more granular scale for smaller items but can become unwieldy for larger estimates.\n\n2. **T-Shirt Sizes**: This method uses sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL for estimation, which can be easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand. It's particularly useful for high-level, initial estimates or when working with business teams unfamiliar with story points.\n\n3. **Powers of 2**: Using 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., can be useful for teams that prefer a wider range of options. This scale provides a clear distinction between each level and can be helpful for teams dealing with a broad range of task sizes.\n\n4. **Three-Point Estimation**: This variation involves estimating best-case, worst-case, and most likely scenarios for each item. It provides a more nuanced view of the potential effort involved and can be particularly useful for tasks with high uncertainty.\n\n5. **Custom Scales**: Some teams create their own scales based on their specific needs. For example, a scale of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100 combines elements of Fibonacci and powers of 2.\n\n## 5. Tools and Software for Planning Poker\n\nWhile Planning Poker can be conducted with physical cards, many teams, especially those working remotely, opt for digital solutions. Some popular tools include:\n\n1. [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live): A web-based tool that integrates with popular project management and video conferencing platforms.\n\n2. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira): Offers integrations to facilitate Planning Poker for teams already using the Atlassian suite.\n\n3. [Trello Power-Ups](https://trello.com/power-ups): Various Trello add-ons provide Planning Poker functionality, allowing teams to estimate directly within their Trello boards.\n\n4. Dedicated mobile apps: Several apps are available for both iOS and Android devices, enabling teams to conduct Planning Poker sessions on the go.\n\n5. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) with integrated apps: Many video conferencing tools now offer integrated Planning Poker apps, facilitating remote estimation sessions.\n\nWhen choosing a tool, consider factors such as ease of use, integration capabilities with your existing project management tools, support for your team's specific estimation method, and features for remote collaboration.\n\n## 6. Best Practices for Effective Planning Poker Sessions\n\nTo get the most out of your Planning Poker sessions, consider these best practices:\n\n1. **Prepare Adequately**: Ensure all stories are well-defined and that the Product Owner is ready to clarify any questions. Send out the list of items to be estimated in advance, allowing team members to familiarize themselves with the stories.\n\n2. **Set Clear Ground Rules**: Establish guidelines for discussion, time limits, and how consensus will be determined. For example, you might decide that if estimates are within two adjacent cards, you'll use the higher estimate without further discussion.\n\n3. **Encourage Participation**: Make sure all team members feel comfortable sharing their opinions and asking questions. Create an environment where everyone's input is valued, regardless of their role or experience level.\n\n4. **Focus on Relative Sizing**: Emphasize that estimates are relative to each other, not absolute time predictions. Encourage team members to think in terms of complexity and effort rather than hours or days.\n\n5. **Use Reference Stories**: Keep a few well-understood stories as benchmarks for comparison. These reference stories can help calibrate estimates across different sessions and team members.\n\n6. **Timebox Discussions**: Prevent prolonged debates by setting time limits for each round of estimation. A common practice is to limit initial discussions to 2-3 minutes per item.\n\n7. **Document Assumptions**: Record any assumptions or clarifications made during the session for future reference. This can be invaluable when revisiting estimates or during sprint planning.\n\n8. **Rotate the Facilitator**: Consider rotating the role of facilitator among team members. This helps maintain engagement and provides different perspectives on how to run the session.\n\n9. **Review and Adapt**: Regularly review the effectiveness of your Planning Poker sessions and be willing to adapt your process. What works for one team may not work for another.\n\n## 7. Planning Poker for Remote Teams\n\nWith the rise of distributed teams, conducting effective Planning Poker sessions remotely has become increasingly important. Here are some tips for virtual Planning Poker:\n\n1. **Use Video Conferencing**: Seeing team members' faces can improve communication and engagement. Tools like [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), or [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) can facilitate face-to-face interactions.\n\n2. **Leverage Digital Tools**: Utilize online Planning Poker platforms that integrate with your video conferencing software. This reduces the friction of estimating, as the Planning Poker session will be visible within the video conferencing app.\n\n3. **Establish Clear Communication Protocols**: Define how team members should indicate they want to speak or ask questions. This could be through a chat function, a raised hand feature, or a agreed-upon verbal cue.\n\n4. **Use Screen Sharing**: Share the backlog or user stories on screen to keep everyone focused. This ensures all team members are looking at the same information during discussions.\n\n5. **Consider Asynchronous Estimation**: For teams across multiple time zones, consider using tools that allow for asynchronous voting and discussion. This can be particularly useful for initial rounds of estimation.\n\n6. **Encourage Active Participation**: In a remote setting, it's easier for some team members to become passive observers. Actively encourage participation from all team members, perhaps by doing a round-robin for initial thoughts on each item.\n\n7. **Use Breakout Rooms**: For larger teams, consider using breakout rooms for smaller group discussions before bringing everyone back together for final estimation.\n\n8. **Have a Dedicated Facilitator**: In remote sessions, a skilled facilitator becomes even more important to keep the session on track, manage time, and ensure all voices are heard.\n\n## 8. Integrating Planning Poker with Other Agile Practices\n\nPlanning Poker doesn't exist in isolation. It's most effective when integrated with other Agile practices:\n\n1. **Sprint Planning**: Use Planning Poker to estimate items for the upcoming sprint, helping to determine sprint capacity. The estimates can inform decisions about which items to include in the sprint backlog.\n\n2. **Backlog Refinement**: Incorporate Planning Poker into regular backlog grooming sessions to keep estimates up-to-date. This ensures that the product backlog is always prioritized and estimated, facilitating smoother sprint planning.\n\n3. **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights from Planning Poker sessions to inform retrospectives and improve future estimations. Analyze the accuracy of past estimates to refine your estimation process over time.\n\n4. **Release Planning**: Leverage estimates from Planning Poker to help forecast release dates and plan product roadmaps. While individual sprint estimates may vary, the aggregate of these estimates can provide valuable insights for longer-term planning.\n\n5. **Team Onboarding**: Use Planning Poker as a tool to help new team members understand the project and the team's estimation process. It can be a great way to get new members engaged and contributing quickly.\n\n6. **Cross-team Calibration**: For organizations with multiple teams working on related projects, Planning Poker can be used as a calibration tool to ensure consistency in estimation across teams.\n\n## 9. Measuring the Success of Planning Poker\n\nTo ensure your Planning Poker sessions are effective, consider tracking these metrics:\n\n1. **Estimation Accuracy**: Compare estimated story points to actual effort expended. This can be done by tracking the number of story points completed in each sprint versus the number planned.\n\n2. **Sprint Velocity Consistency**: Monitor how consistent your team's velocity is from sprint to sprint. While some variation is normal, wild fluctuations might indicate issues with the estimation process.\n\n3. **Time Spent on Estimation**: Track how long your Planning Poker sessions take and aim to optimize efficiency. Long sessions might indicate a need to refine the process or improve story preparation.\n\n4. **Team Satisfaction**: Regularly gather feedback from team members about the estimation process. This could be done through surveys or as part of sprint retrospectives.\n\n5. **Number of Estimation Rounds**: Keep track of how many rounds of voting it typically takes to reach consensus. A high number might indicate a need for better story preparation or more effective facilitation.\n\n6. **Correlation Between Estimates and Business Value**: Over time, analyze whether higher point estimates correlate with higher business value delivery. This can help in prioritizing the product backlog.\n\nRemember, the goal is continuous improvement. Use these metrics to identify areas for refinement in your Planning Poker process, always keeping in mind that the ultimate aim is to deliver value to the customer more effectively.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPlanning Poker is more than just a estimation technique; it's a powerful tool for fostering collaboration, improving project predictability, and enhancing team dynamics.

Whether you're a seasoned Scrum Master or new to the world of agile, understanding these terms can be useful. In this post, we’ll break down these often misused and misspelled terms so you know exactly what they mean and why they all point back to the same technique.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **1. PlanningPoker (aka Planning Poker)**\n\nLet’s start with the classic! **PlanningPoker** (sometimes spelled as a single word, “planningpoker”) is a consensus-based estimation technique used primarily in Scrum and Agile development. The team gathers to estimate the effort required to complete tasks using a deck of cards, with each card representing an estimate of the task’s size or complexity. It’s all about collaboration and reducing bias during sprint planning.\n\n*Need a refresher on how PlanningPoker works? Check out our [comprehensive guide to Planning Poker](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/planning-poker-guide-agile-estimation-techniques).*\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **2. Poker Planning**\n\nAt first glance, **poker planning** sounds like it might be a new form of card game strategy, but don’t be fooled! It’s just a flip of words that refers to the exact same thing: Planning Poker. If you’re seeing “poker planning” in an agile context, rest assured — it’s still the same team-based estimation game.\n\nWe’ve got more on how to avoid common pitfalls when using the Planning Poker technique in our [blog post](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/common-mistakes-planning-poker).\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **3. Scrum Poker**\n\n**Scrum Poker** is simply another name for Planning Poker, often used when teams want to emphasize the technique's connection to the **Scrum** framework. In Scrum, estimating the size of backlog items is a key part of the sprint planning process. And since Planning Poker is one of the most popular methods for doing that, the name **Scrum Poker** came into use.\n\nNeed help running a Scrum planning session? We’ve got you covered with our [guide of the top tools for SCRUM Masters](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/essential-scrum-master-tools).\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **4. Agile Poker**\n\nMuch like Scrum Poker, **Agile Poker** is just a variation in name. Teams outside of Scrum, following broader agile methodologies, often use this term. Whether you’re following Kanban, Lean, or XP, **Agile Poker** fits right in. The process is still the same: gather the team, estimate tasks, and have a bit of fun while doing it.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **5. Backlog Refinement Poker**\n\nNow, this term, **Backlog Refinement Poker**, gives a clue about when teams use Planning Poker. During backlog refinement sessions, teams go through the backlog of tasks and estimate their size. Playing Planning Poker at this stage helps ensure everyone is on the same page about the effort needed before tasks enter a sprint.\n\nNeed to know more about backlog refinement and how to make it more effective?

Pocker Planning**\n\nAh yes, the classic typo: **Pocker Planning**! If you’ve ever typed \"pocker\" instead of \"poker,\" you’re not alone. But rest assured, **Pocker Planning** is still Planning Poker with an extra dash of creativity (or a finger slip). While the typo is common, it’s always fun to see how even small mistakes can give familiar terms a whole new vibe.\n\nFor a typo-free overview of how to make your next sprint planning session a success, head over to our [guide to all roles in a Planning Poker session](https://planningpoker.live/knowledge-base/planning-poker-and-the-scrum-roles).\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **7. Sprint Poker**\n\nMuch like \"Scrum Poker,\" **Sprint Poker** refers to using Planning Poker during a sprint planning meeting. This term emphasizes the technique’s use during the sprint phase of agile development, which is when tasks are estimated and prioritized. It's especially useful if you want to rank for sprint-related keywords.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **8. Estimation Poker**\n\nSome teams refer to Planning Poker as **Estimation Poker** to focus on its core purpose: task estimation. This variation highlights the fact that the primary goal of the technique is to assign effort values to tasks, making it applicable to different stages of the agile workflow, not just sprint planning.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **9. Fibonacci Poker**\n\nOccasionally, you might hear **Fibonacci Poker** mentioned. This term arises because Planning Poker often uses Fibonacci sequence numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) for estimates. The Fibonacci sequence helps teams keep estimates reasonable and avoids over-complicating task sizing.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n## **10. Story Point Poker**\n\nSometimes referred to as **Story Point Poker**, this term zeroes in on the story point estimation system often used with Planning Poker. Story points are a popular unit for measuring the effort required for backlog items in agile teams.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\n### So, What's the Difference?\n\nIn the end, whether you call it **PlanningPoker**, **Poker Planning**, **Scrum Poker**, or even **Pocker Planning**, they all refer to the same technique: a fun, collaborative way to estimate effort and complexity in Agile teams. While the names may differ, the core process remains the same.\n\nSo, next time you see these terms thrown around, feel free to jump into the conversation knowing that you’re all talking about the same thing — even if the spelling is a little off.\n\n<div class=\"separator\"></div>\n\nIf you’re ready to use Planning Poker in your next sprint, why not try it out in [Microsoft Teams](https://planningpoker.live/integrations/teams), [Google Meet](https://planningpoker.live/integrations/meet) or explore the [PlanningPoker.live app](https://planningpoker.live/) to integrate it directly into your remote meetings?\n\nHappy estimating!\n"}]
