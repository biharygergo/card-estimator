PlanningPoker.live has grown steadily, and while it remains a side project for us, we’re thrilled to see how it’s been used by teams around the world. Here are some highlights from the year.\n\n## By the Numbers\n\nThis year, 🏢 31,465 rooms were created on PlanningPoker.live, 🧑‍🧑‍🧑 bringing together 160,633 participants to discuss 132,770 topics. Our users came from all over the world - more than 150 countries - on all of our supported platforms ([web, Teams, Zoom, Meet, Webex](https://planningpoker.live/integrations)). With sessions averaging 16 minutes, that adds up to over **8,390 hours of collaborative planning**! The largest room hosted an impressive 81 participants - we don't even know how they all fit into one tiny room!\n\n🔄 The site saw 1.5 million page views in 2024 and tracked 5.6 million analytics events to help us understand how people are using the platform. On the technical side, 345 [git commits](https://github.com/biharygergo/card-estimator/commits/master/) were made—a mix of bug fixes, improvements, and new features.\n\n<div class=\"image-container\">\n    <img alt=\"PlanningPoker.live statistics for 2024\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dtvhnllmc/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_1680,q_auto/v1711188812/Group_37_1_sgax77\">\n    <p>PlanningPoker.live statistics for 2024</p>\n</div>\n\n## Card Deck Preferences\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of Planning Poker is the variety of card decks available, and user preferences this year were cool to track. The **Default Deck** was the most popular choice, used in 12,865 rooms, closely followed by the **Fibonacci Deck** with 12,862 uses. This makes us think - should we switch the default deck to Fibonacci? Maybe the numbers will tell us more next year!\n\n🎮 Custom decks proved to be a hit too, with 4,822 unique configurations created. Other notable mentions include the **T-Shirt Sizing Deck** (697 rooms), **Half Deck** (176 rooms), and the **Large Deck** (43 rooms).\n\n## 🔍 Feature Highlights\n\nThis year also saw the introduction of several major features, making PlanningPoker.live more versatile and user-friendly:\n\n- **January:** Moved to a credit system for simpler pricing.\n- **February:** Updated design with Material 3 for a modern look and feel.\n- **April:** Added Linear integration for seamless ticket selection.\n- **June:** Introduced organization improvements and org credits for teams.\n- **September:** Launched Google Meet integration for smoother remote collaboration.\n- **October:** Added Microsoft sign-in to expand login options.\n- **All year:** Focused on performance, SEO enhancements, and bug fixes to ensure a reliable experience.\n\n## 🚀 Behind the Scenes\n\nWhile the platform has been busy with users, we have been working to keep things running smoothly. From analyzing data to make improvements to shipping new updates, we’ve kept the focus on delivering a simple yet effective tool. PlanningPoker.live continues to be a tool for teams to work together, whether it’s for sprint planning, backlog refinement, or other collaborative tasks. Seeing the platform bring people together—from small teams to larger groups—is incredibly rewarding for us as creators. We are also continuosly asking your feedback with the feedback pop-up you often see - we read every piece of written feedback and are happy to report an overall 4.3/5 star rating for 2024.\n\n## 👀 Looking Ahead\n\nAs we step into 2025, our goal is to keep improving PlanningPoker.live while maintaining the simplicity that users appreciate. Whether it’s refining existing features, exploring new ideas, or responding to your feedback, we’re excited for what’s next.\n\nThank you for making 2024 such a memorable year for PlanningPoker.live. This project might be small, but seeing how it’s used makes all the effort worthwhile. Here’s to another year of productive planning!\n\nGergely Bihary & Kristóf Nagy\n"}
