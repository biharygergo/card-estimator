            <mat-panel-title><h3>What is planning poker?</h3></mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Planning poker, also called scrum poker or pointing poker, is a
            consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating effort or
            relative size of development goals in software development. Agile
            teams worldwide use planning poker to improve their sprint planning
            process and create more accurate estimates for user stories and
            tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a planning poker session, team members use numbered cards to
            vote on the complexity of each user story, promoting equal
            participation and reducing estimation bias. The Fibonacci sequence
            (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) is commonly used in planning poker
            estimation as it reflects the inherent uncertainty in larger
            estimates and helps teams focus on relative sizing rather than
            precise time estimates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Planning poker estimation is particularly effective for remote and
            distributed agile teams who need a structured approach to sprint
            planning. By combining the wisdom of the entire team, planning poker
            helps identify risks early, improves team communication, and leads
            to more reliable sprint commitments. Many Scrum Masters and Product
            Owners consider planning poker an essential part of their agile
            estimation toolkit.
          </p>
          <p>
            With PlanningPoker.live, teams can conduct efficient planning poker
            sessions online with features like JIRA integration, custom card
            sets, and anonymous voting - making the estimation process seamless
            for both co-located and remote agile teams. Planning poker has
            become the industry standard for agile estimation in companies of
            all sizes, from startups to enterprises like Google, Amazon, and
            Netflix.

            <mat-panel-title><h3>How to play?</h3></mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            During a planning poker session, team members estimate by
            simultaneously revealing numbered cards rather than verbally sharing
            estimates. This synchronized revelation technique effectively
            eliminates anchoring biasâ€”a cognitive phenomenon where initial
            estimates unduly influence subsequent onesâ€”resulting in more
            accurate and independent assessments of user story complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In digital planning poker platforms like PlanningPoker.live,
            participants join virtual estimation rooms where their selected
            cards are displayed on screen once everyone has voted. This online
            approach maintains the core methodology while enhancing efficiency
            through automation and providing additional features for remote
            agile teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically lasting 30-45 minutes, planning poker sessions are
            facilitated by a Scrum Master or Product Owner who presents each
            user story for estimation. This collaborative process encourages
            meaningful discussions about requirements, potential risks, and
            implementation approaches, ensuring all team members contribute
            their expertise to sprint planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teams can customize their estimation experience by selecting from
            various card sets, including the popular Fibonacci sequence (1, 2,
            3, 5, 8, 13, 21), modified Fibonacci, T-shirt sizes, or custom
            scales. These estimation units represent relative effort or
            complexity rather than absolute time, helping teams create more
            reliable sprint forecasts and velocity measurements.
