  <h1>What is planning poker?</h1>
  <p>
    Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified
    technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of
    development goals in software development. In planning poker, members of the
    group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table,
    instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates
    are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid
    the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a
    precedent for subsequent estimates.
