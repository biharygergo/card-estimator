### Introduction
Efficiency and cohesion are key in any collaborative setting, especially for remote software engineering teams. That's why we've developed a seamless Planning Poker app that integrates directly into Microsoft Teams. With this tool, there's no need to navigate away from your meeting window to conduct estimation sessions. In this guide, we'll walk you through the simple process of installing the Planning Poker app in Teams and provide tips for maximizing its utility.

### Installation

Simply search for "Planning Poker" or navigate directly to the [app listing](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200005858?tab=Overview). There, you'll find basic information and screenshots showcasing its functionality. Rest assured, the app only requires minimal permissions to function within Teams.

- **Install for a meeting:** Incorporate the app as a tab or an app within the meeting's chat or call screen.

For regularly scheduled planning meetings, such as "Weekly Planning," selecting the appropriate meeting ensures the best user experience. Once installed, a success screen confirms that everything is ready for use.
