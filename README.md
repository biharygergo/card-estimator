# Planning Poker - Made with Angular and Firebase

## What is this?
At Prezi, we worked in a usual SCRUM setup that must be familiar to many software engineers — planning meetings, stand-ups, and retros. During our planning meetings, we estimated projects/cards while sitting around a table and showing hands-on the count of three. This worked well before the pandemic, but as soon as we had to move to Zoom it wasn’t so efficient anymore. It was no longer easy to tell what the consensus was and it was easy to mess up the countdown and fall victim to bias by seeing other teammates’ votes before revealing your own.

In order to have more effective planning meetings, we turned to the internet to find a tool that would allow us to have the same experience of being in the same room together. We tried several apps, and while there are excellent free solutions, they didn’t quite fit with the workflow that we were used to.

So, given that I like creating new projects and thought that making a new planning poker app would be fun, I set out to create [planningpoker.live](https://planningpoker.live)!
