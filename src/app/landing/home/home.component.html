            <mat-panel-title><h3>What is planning poker?</h3></mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Planning poker, also called scrum poker, estimation poker, pointing poker, or agile poker, is a
            consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating effort or
            relative size of development goals in software development. Agile
            teams worldwide use this poker planning method to improve their sprint planning
            process and create more accurate story point estimates for user stories and
            tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a planning poker session, team members use numbered planning poker cards to
            vote on the complexity of each user story, promoting equal
            participation and reducing estimation bias. The Fibonacci sequence
            (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) is commonly used in scrum poker
            estimation as it reflects the inherent uncertainty in larger
            story point estimates and helps teams focus on relative sizing rather than
            precise time estimates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Planning poker estimation is particularly effective for remote and
            distributed agile teams who need a structured approach to sprint
            planning. By combining the wisdom of the entire team, planning poker
            helps identify risks early, improves team communication, and leads
            to more reliable sprint commitments. Many Scrum Masters and Product
            Owners consider planning poker an essential part of their agile
            estimation toolkit.

          <p>
            During an online planning poker session, team members estimate by
            simultaneously revealing numbered cards rather than verbally sharing
            estimates. This synchronized revelation technique in scrum poker effectively
            eliminates anchoring bias—a cognitive phenomenon where initial
            estimates unduly influence subsequent ones—resulting in more
            accurate and independent story point assessments of user story complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In free online planning poker tools like PlanningPoker.live,
            participants join virtual estimation poker rooms where their selected
            cards are displayed on screen once everyone has voted. This online
            scrum poker approach maintains the core poker planning methodology while enhancing efficiency
            through automation and providing additional features for remote
            agile teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically lasting 30-45 minutes, planning poker sessions are
            facilitated by a Scrum Master or Product Owner who presents each
            user story for estimation. This collaborative process encourages
            meaningful discussions about requirements, potential risks, and
            implementation approaches, ensuring all team members contribute
            their expertise to sprint planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teams can customize their estimation experience by selecting from
            various card sets, including the popular Fibonacci sequence (1, 2,
            3, 5, 8, 13, 21), modified Fibonacci, T-shirt sizes, or custom
            scales. These estimation units represent relative effort or
            complexity rather than absolute time, helping teams create more
            reliable sprint forecasts and velocity measurements.
