It is a fun and engaging way for teams to apply relative estimates to planned work. Planning Poker can be used to improve Sprint Planning meetings and deliver more value to customers.\n\nThe three Scrum roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers, all play a role in using Planning Poker effectively.\n\n### The Product Owner\n\nThe Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, which is a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done to develop the product. The Product Owner also works with the team to estimate the effort required for each Product Backlog Item (PBI).\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Product Owner is responsible for:\n\n- Reading the PBI aloud to the team\n- Answering any questions that the team has about the PBI\n- Helping the team to reach a consensus on the estimate for the PBI\n\n### The Scrum Master\n\nThe Scrum Master is responsible for helping the team to follow the Scrum framework. The Scrum Master also helps the team to remove any impediments that are preventing them from delivering value to customers.\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Scrum Master is responsible for:\n\n- Facilitating the session and keeping it on track\n- Ensuring that everyone on the team is participating and that their voice is heard\n- Helping the team to resolve any conflicts or disagreements\n\n### The Developers\n\nThe Developers are responsible for delivering the work in the Sprint Backlog. They are also responsible for estimating the effort required for each PBI.\n\nDuring a Planning Poker session, the Developers are responsible for:\n\n- Selecting a Planning Poker card that represents their estimate of the effort required for the PBI\n- Discussing their estimates with the team and trying to reach a consensus\n- Providing feedback on the estimates of other team members\n\n## How the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively\n\nThe Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively by:\n\n- **Communicating effectively.** It is important for all three roles to communicate effectively during a Planning Poker session. The Product Owner needs to be able to clearly explain the PBI, the Scrum Master needs to be able to facilitate the discussion, and the Developers need to be able to share their estimates and feedback.\n- **Trusting each other.** It is also important for all three roles to trust each other. The Product Owner needs to trust the Developers to provide accurate estimates, and the Scrum Master needs to trust the Product Owner and Developers to work together to reach a consensus.\n- **Being open to feedback.** Everyone on the team should be open to feedback from the other team members. This will help to ensure that the estimates are accurate and that the team is on the same page.\n\nBy following these tips, the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers can work together to use Planning Poker effectively and improve their team's velocity.\n\n**Additional tips for using Planning Poker effectively:**\n\n- Use a Fibonacci sequence to estimate effort. This will help to avoid estimating in whole numbers and to make more accurate estimates.\n- Be honest with your estimates. Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" or to change your estimate if you hear new information.\n- Have fun! Planning Poker should be a fun and collaborative experience. Don't take it too seriously.\n- Use an online tool for estimating, as it makes things easier to track and more enjoyable. Give [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live) a try!\n\nBy using Planning Poker effectively, you can improve your team's velocity and deliver more value to your customers.\n"},{"title":"Comparing Agile estimation techniques","description":"Agile estimation techniques are essential for helping teams plan their work and set realistic expectations.

Relative estimation is more accurate than absolute estimation. When estimating tasks, compare them to other tasks that you have completed in the past.\n* Be realistic. Don't underestimate or overestimate the effort required to complete tasks. Be realistic and honest with your estimates.\n* Update your estimates regularly. As you learn more about the work, update your estimates accordingly.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAgile estimation techniques are a valuable tool for helping teams plan their work and set realistic expectations. By choosing the right technique for the job and using it effectively, you can improve your team's ability to deliver on its commitments.\n\n## Additional Tips\n\nHere are some additional tips for using agile estimation techniques:\n\n* Use a tool to help you manage your estimates. There are a number of tools available that can help you to track and manage your estimates.\n* Review your estimates regularly. Meet with your team on a regular basis to review your estimates and make sure that they are still accurate.\n* Be flexible. Agile estimation is an iterative process. It is important to be flexible and willing to adjust your estimates as needed.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your team's use of agile estimation techniques and improve your team's ability to plan and deliver on its commitments.\n"},{"title":"How to use Planning Poker to improve your sprint planning meetings","description":"Learn how to use Planning Poker to improve your sprint planning meetings and deliver more value to your customers.","slug":"how-to-use-planning-poker-to-improve-sprint-planning","lastUpdated":"2023/10/07","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"pexels-fauxels-3184306_vv2kvt","coverImageAlt":"A group of people during a meeting","content":"## What is Planning Poker?\n\nPlanning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort in agile software development. It is a fun and engaging way for teams to apply relative estimates to planned work. Planning Poker can be used to improve sprint planning meetings in a number of ways:\n\n- **It helps to reduce bias and groupthink.** In traditional estimation techniques, the loudest or most influential team members may tend to dominate the discussion and influence the estimates. Planning Poker helps to level the playing field by giving everyone an equal voice.\n- **It encourages collaboration and communication.** Planning Poker is a team exercise that requires everyone to participate and share their thoughts. This helps to foster collaboration and communication within the team.\n- **It leads to more realistic estimates.** Planning Poker estimates are based on the collective knowledge and experience of the team. This makes them more likely to be realistic and achievable than estimates that are made by individuals.\n\n## How to use Planning Poker in your sprint planning meeting\n\n1. **Prepare.** Make sure that everyone on the team has a deck of Planning Poker cards. You can use physical cards or an online tool such as [PlanningPoker.live](https://planningpoker.live). Using an online tool is a good idea, since it automatically tracks estimates, history and calculates statistics.\n2. **Read the user story.** The Product Owner reads the user story aloud to the team and sets the topic in the app.\n3. **Estimate.** Each team member selects a card from their deck that represents their estimate of the effort required to complete the user story.\n4. **Reveal.** Everyone reveals their cards at the same time. When played online, this step is done by the leader of the meeting.\n5. **Discuss.** If the estimates are widely different, the team discusses the reasons for the differences and tries to reach a consensus.\n6. **Repeat.** Steps 3-5 are repeated until the team reaches a consensus on an estimate for the user story.\n\n## Tips for using Planning Poker effectively\n\n- **Use a Fibonacci sequence.** Planning Poker cards are typically numbered in a Fibonacci sequence, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89. This sequence helps to avoid the tendency to estimate in whole numbers. You can even decide on your own card deck, which is supported by most online tools as well.\n- **Use relative estimates.** Planning Poker estimates are relative to each other, rather than to a specific unit of time. This helps to avoid the problem of overestimating or underestimating complex tasks.\n- **Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know.\"** If you don't have enough information to estimate a user story, it's okay to say so. The goal of Planning Poker is to get a rough estimate of the effort required, not to be precise. When played online, you can add a \"Pass\" card to the deck to represent this vote.\n- **Don't be afraid to change your mind.** If you hear new information during the discussion phase, you can change your estimate. The goal is to reach a consensus on an estimate that everyone is comfortable with.\n\n## Additional tips\n\n- **Start with a small set of user stories.** Don't try to estimate all of the user stories for the Sprint in one sitting. Start with a small set of user stories, and then come back to the rest later.\n- **Take breaks.** Planning Poker can be mentally draining, so it's important to take breaks. Get up and move around, or do something else for a while.\n- **Keep a human connection.** Use Planning Poker in real-life or during a video conference. You can [install an extension](https://planningpoker.live/features) of PlanningPoker.live in your favorite video conferencing tool to see each other during the session.\n- **Have fun!** Planning Poker should be a fun and collaborative experience. Don't take it too seriously.\n\nPlanning Poker is a powerful tool that can help you to improve your sprint planning meetings and deliver more value to your customers. By following the tips above, you can use Planning Poker effectively to estimate the effort required for your Sprint Backlog items.\n"},{"title":"How to estimate JIRA issues with Planning Poker","description":"In this short tutorial you can learn how to set up an integration with JIRA in PlanningPoker.live and estimate tickets with ease","slug":"how-to-estimate-jira-issues-with-planning-poker","lastUpdated":"2023/10/25","author":"Gergely Bihary","coverImageId":"topics","coverImageAlt":"A graphic showing issues stacked over each other","content":"\n### Introduction\n\nPlanning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating effort or complexity.
