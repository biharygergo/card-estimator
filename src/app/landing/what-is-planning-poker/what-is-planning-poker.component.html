      <ul>
        <li>
          Planning Poker is a gamified technique used by Agile teams to estimate
          work effort collaboratively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Team members use numbered cards (often Fibonacci sequence) to vote
          privately on task size (story points).
        </li>
        <li>Votes are revealed simultaneously to avoid anchoring bias.</li>
        <li>
          Differences in estimates lead to discussions that improve
          understanding and build consensus.
        </li>

        ><strong>Planning Poker</strong></a
      >
      (also known as <em>Scrum Poker</em> or <em>Pointing Poker</em>) is a
      collaborative, gamified technique for estimating the effort or size of
      work items in Agile projects. It is one of several
      <a href="/knowledge-base/comparing-agile-estimation-techniques"
        >Agile estimation techniques</a
      >
      but is most commonly used by software development teams practicing Scrum
      or other Agile methodologies. The technique can be applied in any project
      where team estimation is needed. In Planning Poker, each team member
      selects a card (usually from a special deck of numbered cards) to
      privately estimate a task, and then all cards are revealed simultaneously.
      This process encourages <strong>consensus-based estimation</strong> and

        >avoids anchoring bias</a

      (i.e. no one is influenced by another's estimate before revealing their
      own). By discussing differing estimates and reaching agreement, teams can
      estimate user stories or tasks in a fun yet structured way.

      product backlog items (like user stories) during backlog refinement or
      sprint planning sessions. The "poker" aspect refers to the playing cards
      used for voting on estimates, adding a game-like element that makes the
      process engaging and inclusive.

    <h2 id="how-does-planning-poker-work-">How Does Planning Poker Work?</h2>
    <p>
      At its core, Planning Poker works by harnessing the collective wisdom of
      the team and ensuring everyone's voice is heard equally. The workflow of a
      typical Planning Poker session is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Team assembly and roles:</strong> The estimation meeting
          brings together the development team (and sometimes testers,
          designers, etc.), usually facilitated by a Scrum Master or team lead
          acting as a <strong>moderator</strong>. The Product Owner or requester
          of the work is present to clarify requirements but may not vote.

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Use of a special card deck:</strong> Each Planning Poker card
          deck contains a predefined set of values. A common set is the modified
          <strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong>:
          <strong>0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100</strong>, etc., often
          including
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker#:~:text=The%20cards%20in%20the%20deck,1%2C%202%2C%204%2C%208%2C%20etc"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >special cards</a
          >
          like <strong>"?"</strong> (unsure), <strong>∞</strong> (too large to
          estimate), or a <strong>coffee cup</strong> (break needed). (Explore

            >different card sets</a
          >.) These values represent story points or relative effort – they
          increase non-linearly to reflect greater uncertainty for larger tasks.
          For example, a jump from 5 to 8 or 8 to 13 points illustrates that
          <a

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >larger tasks carry more uncertainty</a
          >, rather than implying exact multiples of effort. By limiting the
          card values to a coarse scale, the team avoids false precision and
          focuses on relative sizing.

          <strong>Private estimation:</strong> For each user story or task, the
          Product Owner (or whoever is requesting the estimate)
          <strong>presents the story</strong> to the team, explaining its
          details and acceptance criteria. Team members have the chance to ask
          questions and discuss the work to ensure everyone has a common
          understanding of what's being estimated. Once discussion is done, each
          estimator <strong>selects a card privately</strong> that represents
          their estimate of the story's size or effort (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker#:~:text=,consensus"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >source</a
          >). Importantly, they do this without revealing their choice to
          others.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Simultaneous reveal:</strong> After everyone has chosen a
          card, all participants
          <strong>reveal their cards at the same time</strong> (e.g., by turning
          cards face-up) (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker#:~:text=,it%20runs%20out%20all%20discussion"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >source</a
          >). This simultaneous "vote" prevents any single estimate from biasing
          the others (avoiding the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker#:~:text=principles%20,a%20precedent%20for%20subsequent%20estimates"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Discussion and consensus:</strong> If all team members
          selected the same value, that estimate is quickly accepted as the
          consensus for that item. Often, however, there will be a spread of
          chosen values (especially for complex or unclear tasks). In that case,
          the team discusses the differences. Typically, the person who picked
          the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker#:~:text=,Moderator%20can%20negotiate%20the%20consensus"

            >highest value and the one who picked the lowest</a
          >
          are each given a chance to explain their reasoning ("why did you think
          it would be so hard/easy?"). This discussion often uncovers
          assumptions, risks, or aspects of the task that others hadn't
          considered. After discussion, the team votes again on the same story
          (either immediately or after a short break). This cycle of
          <strong>estimate → reveal → discuss</strong> repeats until the group
          converges on a consensus estimate that everyone can agree on (<a

            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >source</a
          >). The moderator may impose a timebox (sometimes using an egg timer)
          to keep the conversation efficient (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker#:~:text=offer%20their%20justification%20for%20their,introduced%20by%20the%20soapboxes"

            >source</a
          >).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By the end of a Planning Poker session, each backlog item discussed will
      have an agreed-upon estimate. The strength of this method lies in the
      healthy debate it generates and the collective knowledge it captures. All
      team members contribute, newer or quieter members have an equal voice
      (since everyone must play a card), and the whole team buys into the final
      estimates.
      <a
        href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects#:~:text=According%20to%20one%20study%2C%20estimates,more%20accurate%20than%20individual%20ones"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Studies have found</a
      >
      that group estimates via Planning Poker can be more accurate than
      individual estimates, thanks to the pooling of insights and the iterative
      refinement through discussion. The technique is also
      <strong>fun and engaging</strong> – the game-like format can make a
      normally dry activity more enjoyable and team-building.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Use beyond software:</strong> While Planning Poker is an agile
      estimation staple for software teams, it's not limited to software
      development. Any cross-functional team that needs to estimate work can
      adopt this technique. For example, marketing or design teams might
      estimate campaign tasks or design efforts using a similar card-based
      approach, and project teams in construction or R&D could estimate phases
      of work. The key ingredients are tasks that need estimating, a team with
      different perspectives, and a desire for consensus. Smaller teams tend to
      find it easiest to reach consensus, but even larger groups can

      to make Planning Poker work for them. In essence, if you have a backlog of
      items (features, projects, user stories, etc.) and want a group estimate,

      How to Play Planning Poker (Step-by-Step)
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you're a Scrum Master, team lead, or anyone looking to run a Planning
      Poker session, here's a step-by-step guide. This will walk you through how
      to play Planning Poker with your team:

      class="article-image tall" />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Prepare the Cards or Tool:</strong> Ensure each participant
          has a complete Planning Poker card deck (physical cards) or access to
          an online Planning Poker app. Explain the
          <strong>estimation scale</strong> you'll use – for example, the
          <a
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects#:~:text=Distribute%20an%20identical%20deck%20of,13%2C%2020%2C%2040%2C%20and%20100"

            >Fibonacci sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100</a
          >
          is very common. Make sure everyone understands what the scale
          represents (usually <strong>story points</strong> – a relative unit of
          effort). If using physical cards, distribute one deck to each
          estimator. If using a digital tool, have everyone join the session on
          their devices. (Some teams also prepare an optional
          <strong>timer</strong> to limit discussion per item, and a whiteboard
          or digital board to note discussion points.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Present the Story or Item:</strong> The moderator (often the
          Product Owner or Scrum Master) picks the next user story or task from
          the backlog and
          <a
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects#:~:text=At%20the%20beginning%20of%20a,user%20%28i.e.%20the%20customer"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            ><strong>reads it aloud</strong> to the team</a
          >. The story should be clearly stated (e.g., via a user story
          description) including the desired outcome. This ensures that everyone
          is focused on the same item and understands its context. The moderator
          or product owner should be available to answer any questions on
          requirements or acceptance criteria.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Discuss and Ask Questions:</strong> The team now discusses the
          item to clarify details and surface any assumptions. This is a
          critical step –
          <a
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects#:~:text=Step%203%3A%20Discuss%20the%20story"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >team members can talk about</a
          >
          how they might implement the story, potential complexities,
          dependencies, or risks involved. For example, they might ask:
          <em>Do we have the design ready?</em>,
          <em>How many people might need to work on this?</em>,
          <em>Are there any unknowns or external dependencies?</em> (<a
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects#:~:text=Once%20the%20group%20finishes%20listening,discussion%20points%20will%20likely%20include"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >source</a
          >). The goal is not to solutionize in detail, but to ensure everyone
          has a roughly equal understanding of what the work entails. Take this
          time to resolve ambiguities: a few minutes of clarification can
          prevent widely divergent estimates or nasty surprises later. (If the
          conversation reveals the story is too large or vague, the team might
          choose to split the story or do a quick spike and come back later
          rather than estimate something poorly defined.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Estimate Silently:</strong> Once the discussion winds down and
          everyone feels ready to estimate, each team member
          <strong>selects a card in private</strong>. Without revealing it,
          choose the card that best represents your estimate of the story's size
          or effort (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker#:~:text=,consensus"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >source</a
          >). Remember, these numbers are relative; a "5" might mean a task of
          medium complexity if your team treats a "1" as a very small, quick
          task. If a team member feels completely unsure, they might pick the
          "?" card (if available) to indicate confusion, or request more
          discussion. It's important that during this time no one says any
          numbers out loud or gives hints – everyone should think independently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Reveal the Cards:</strong> Once all participants have a card
          selected, the moderator calls for a reveal and

          of values (which is okay!). For instance, three people might have
          picked "8", one picked "5", and one picked "13". Take note of the
          range and any outliers (highest and lowest). If by chance all the
          cards show the same number, congrats – you've reached instant
          consensus, and you can

          <strong>Discuss Differences and Reach Consensus:</strong> If the
          revealed estimates differ, the moderator facilitates a quick
          discussion. Typically, start by having the
          <strong>outliers explain their reasoning</strong> – ask the person(s)
          who gave the highest estimate to explain why they think the task is
          larger or riskier, and the person(s) who gave the lowest estimate to
          explain why they believe it's simpler (<a

          insights. Perhaps someone thought of a scenario or requirement others
          missed, or someone else has past experience that makes them see the
          task as easier than others expect. After each side shares, allow a
          brief open discussion so the team can consider these points. Then
          <strong>vote again</strong> on the same item: each member selects a
          card (they can stick with their previous estimate or adjust based on
          the discussion) and all reveal together. The range of answers will
          usually narrow down.

          >
          until the team converges on a single value or at least a very tight
          range. You may not always get perfect unanimity, but the aim is a
          consensus that everyone can live with (for example, everyone's card is
          either an 8 or a 5, and after discussion the person with 8 is okay
          going with 5). Once consensus is reached, record that estimate for the
          story. Then proceed to the next backlog item and go back to step 2.

          <strong>Wrap Up:</strong> After all selected stories have been
          estimated (or time for the session runs out), conclude the session.
          The team now has a set of estimates for upcoming work, which can be
          used to plan the sprint or project timeline. It's good to briefly
          reflect on the session: did any story cause a lot of debate? Are there
          follow-up actions (like splitting an overly large story, doing
          research on an unclear one, or noting assumptions made)? The Scrum
          Master or facilitator can note these. Also, thank the team for their
          participation – Planning Poker works best when everyone is honest and
          engaged, so acknowledge that effort.

      Planning Poker has become popular for good reason –
      <a href="/knowledge-base/benefits-of-planning-poker"

      that improve the estimation process and team dynamics:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Avoids Anchoring Bias:</strong> Because all estimates are
          revealed simultaneously, no one gets

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >influenced by someone else blurting out a number first</a
          >. This ensures each team member provides an honest, independent
          estimate based on their own perspective. It leads to more truthful
          estimates and prevents a situation where everyone simply goes along
          with the highest paid person's guess.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Encourages Full Team Participation:</strong> Every estimator
          must play a card, so everyone on the team contributes. This gives
          <strong>equal voice</strong> to all team members, including those who
          might be junior or typically quiet (<a
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects#:~:text=reference%20for%20comparison.%20,questions%20on%20the%20requirement%20and"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >source</a
          >). It often empowers team members to share insights they otherwise
          might keep to themselves. The game format can make it easier for
          people to speak up since it's just "playing a card."
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fosters Discussion and Knowledge Sharing:</strong> When
          there's a difference in estimates, the ensuing discussion is
          incredibly valuable. Team members explain their thought process, which
          often uncovers hidden requirements, risks, or dependencies. This
          <strong>identifies gaps</strong> in understanding early (<a
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/scrum-poker-for-agile-projects#:~:text=,questions%20on%20the%20requirement%20and"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >source</a
          >). The team ends up learning from each other – for example, a tester
          might raise a scenario that developers hadn't considered, or a
          developer might clarify that a certain task is easier thanks to
          existing libraries. This shared understanding improves the quality of
          planning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Builds Consensus and Commitment:</strong> Since the final
          estimate is agreed upon by the whole team, there is a stronger sense
          of <strong>commitment</strong> to delivering that story within the
          estimate. The team collectively owns the estimate, rather than it
          feeling "imposed" by a manager or single planner. This can improve
          morale and trust in the estimates.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Relative Estimation is Fast and Flexible:</strong> By using
          abstract story points or relative sizes (instead of hours), teams can
          estimate quickly without getting bogged down in details. Planning
          Poker's use of coarse numbers (e.g., Fibonacci series) keeps estimates
          high-level and easier to think about. It's more about comparing items
          ("Is Story A roughly twice as complex as Story B?") than guessing
          exact durations. This often proves faster and less contentious,
          especially for long-term planning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>More Accurate over Time:</strong> When teams regularly
          practice Planning Poker, they often calibrate their understanding of
          story points and improve estimation accuracy.
          <a

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >One study noted</a
          >
          that Planning Poker estimates tend to be more accurate than individual
          estimates for the same tasks. Over multiple sprints, the team also
          builds up historical data (e.g., how many story points they complete
          on average) which can improve future forecasting. The process of
          discussing outlier estimates means that uncertainties are addressed,
          which can lead to more realistic numbers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fun and Team-Building:</strong> The gamified nature (using
          cards, sometimes joking with "coffee break" cards) can make the
          session more <strong>enjoyable</strong> than a typical meeting. Teams
          often find the process lighthearted and a break from routine. That fun
          factor should not be underestimated – it can make planning sessions
          something people look forward to rather than dread. Also, as a
          collaborative exercise, Planning Poker helps build camaraderie and a
          sense of teamwork as everyone works together to solve the "puzzle" of
          estimating each story.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Leverage Integrations:</strong> For remote or hybrid teams,
          using Planning Poker tools that integrate with your existing
          communication platforms can streamline the process. Look for

    <p>
      Of course, like any technique, Planning Poker isn't a silver bullet. It
      assumes the team has a baseline understanding of the work – if a story is
      truly novel or everyone is clueless, the estimates might still be wild
      guesses (in such cases, a spike or research story might be needed). Also,
      reaching consensus can sometimes give a false sense of certainty; teams
      should remember that an estimate is just an educated guess, not a promise.
      If one strong personality dominates the discussion after the cards are
      revealed, it could sway others unduly – facilitators should watch out for
      this and keep the discussion balanced. Overall, though, the benefits of
      Planning Poker in promoting healthy discussion and shared ownership often
      outweigh the downsides, especially when the team follows some best
      practices.

      Tips and Best Practices for Effective Planning Poker
    </h2>
    <p>
      To get the most out of Planning Poker, consider these tips and best
      practices used by experienced Scrum Masters and Agile teams:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Break Down Large Items First:</strong> If a user story or task
          seems very large or complex (team members are inclined to throw an "∞"
          card or the highest value), that's a red flag. It's often better to
          split the story into smaller pieces before estimating. Planning Poker
          works best when estimating items of roughly manageable size (for
          example, something that at most could be done in a few days by a
          couple of people). If not, you may find everyone constantly voting the
          maximum card or feeling unsure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Agree on a Reference Scale:</strong> Calibrate the team by
          discussing one or two reference stories that you all agree on (e.g.,
          "Story X is definitely a 5 and Story Y is a 2"). This helps especially
          with new teams or new scales. Having anchor examples in mind gives
          people a comparative sense when voting. Over time, as the team sees
          completed stories and their point values, this internal calibration
          improves.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Ensure Understanding Before Estimating:</strong> Encourage
          questions during the discussion phase. If someone is quiet, the
          facilitator might directly ask them if they have any concerns.
          Sometimes a simple clarification can bring estimates closer. Make sure
          everyone knows <em>what</em> is being asked – e.g., are we estimating
          just dev effort, or dev+test, or overall calendar time? Typically
          story points encompass all work for that item (analysis, development,
          testing), but align on this definition so that votes are based on the
          same assumptions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Timebox the Discussion:</strong> It's easy for estimation
          meetings to drag on if the team dives too deep into design details or
          tangents. Use a timebox per item (some teams use 5–10 minutes per
          story as a rule of thumb, maybe less for small items). Tools like an
          <strong>egg timer</strong> or a timing app can
          <a

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >enforce this</a
          >. If time is up and no consensus, consider capturing the main points
          and moving on – or take a quick break and return with fresh eyes.
          Timeboxing keeps the session lively and prevents fatigue.

          class="article-image" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Moderate Fairly:</strong> The Scrum Master or facilitator
          should encourage balanced participation. After a reveal, ensure that
          both high and low estimators get to explain without interruption. If
          one person consistently pushes their view, gently remind the team to
          consider all perspectives. The goal is <em>consensus</em>, not
          persuasion by volume. Sometimes taking a short break or moving to the
          next story and coming back can defuse tension on a contentious item.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Use Online Tools for Remote Teams:</strong> If your team is
          distributed, make use of the many
          <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            ><strong>online Planning Poker tools</strong></a
          >
          (such as <strong>PlanningPoker.live</strong>, etc.) that provide
          digital card decks and automated reveals. These tools often have extra
          features like timers, the ability for observers (like Product Owners)
          to watch without voting, and exporting results to Jira or other
          project trackers. Make sure everyone knows how to use the tool and
          test it upfront to avoid technical hiccups during the session.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Don't Force a Consensus Unrealistically:</strong> While
          consensus is the aim, sometimes you might settle for a majority or a
          compromise if time is short. For instance, if most people are at 8 and
          one at 5 and one at 13 after multiple rounds, the team might agree to
          call it an 8 and move on. The outliers should feel heard and be able
          to live with the decision. Remember that estimates can be revised
          later if needed; the important part is the conversation that happened.
          Some teams use the <strong>average of votes</strong> as the estimate
          if consensus is hard, but use this sparingly as it can undermine the
          collaborative intent. It's better to figure out why there's
          disagreement. Only average or compromise as a last resort.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Review Estimates After Completion:</strong> A great learning
          tool is to occasionally look back at a story after it's done and
          compare actual effort to the estimated points. If there were
          significant deviations (too high or too low), discuss why. This isn't
          to blame anyone, but to improve future estimating (maybe the team
          consistently underestimates front-end tasks, or a certain type of work
          always turns out harder). Over time, this retrospective view will
          sharpen the team's estimation skills and also validate (or adjust) the
          point scale being used.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By following these practices, teams can make their Planning Poker sessions
      more efficient and effective. The idea is to keep the exercise
      <strong>lightweight but focused</strong> – it should be about quickly
      getting a sense of relative size, not detailed task planning. If done
      right, Planning Poker helps the team build a shared understanding of the
      work and trust in each other's judgment.

      Using Planning Poker Outside of Software Development
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Planning Poker is most often discussed in the context of software
      development and Agile scrum teams, its principles can benefit
      <strong>any team</strong> that needs to estimate work collaboratively. The
      technique is domain-agnostic: it's about experts coming together to pool
      their knowledge and arrive at an estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some examples of where Planning Poker (or a variation of it) can be used
      outside software:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Marketing and Creative Teams:</strong> Imagine a marketing
          team estimating the effort required for various campaign tasks
          (writing content, designing graphics, scheduling social media, etc.).
          They could use Planning Poker cards to estimate the relative effort or
          complexity of each campaign component. This ensures the whole team
          (writers, designers, analysts) agrees on what's considered a "small"
          vs "large" task, and it can reveal if, say, designers see a particular
          request as very time-consuming while others thought it was trivial.
          The marketing team can then adjust scope or timelines based on these
          estimates.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Product Design and UX:</strong> A UX design team could use
          Planning Poker to estimate design stories or research tasks. For
          instance, estimating the effort for a user research study versus a
          simple UI mockup. Each team member (researchers, designers,
          prototypers) might have different perspectives on difficulty. Through
          Planning Poker, they can surface those differences early.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>IT Operations or DevOps:</strong> Even in operational
          settings, such as estimating the effort to set up infrastructure or
          migrate servers, a team can use Planning Poker. Different engineers
          might have knowledge of different parts of the system, and by
          discussing their estimates (why one thinks a migration is a 2 versus
          another thinking it's an 8), they can uncover tasks like "we need to
          update the schema, which is why it's higher."
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Project Management and Other Industries:</strong> In
          construction project planning, a team of architects, engineers, and
          contractors might estimate phases of a project (though they often have
          other methods). But a simplified Planning Poker could be used in early
          project estimation to get a rough idea from all stakeholders.
          Likewise, in industries like healthcare administration or nonprofit
          projects, wherever a group needs to estimate workloads (grant proposal
          efforts, event planning tasks), the concept of hidden voting and
          discussing gaps can be useful. It promotes cross-functional
          understanding and a democratic approach to planning.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When using Planning Poker outside software, you might adapt the
      terminology (maybe call it "estimation poker" or just "team estimation
      game") and adjust what the "points" mean (it could be hours, days, or a
      custom unit of effort). The key is still the conversation and convergence
      on a shared estimate. By mentioning and embracing these other use cases,
      you can highlight the versatility of Planning Poker. It's not just a tool
      for developers, but for
      <strong>any collaborative team</strong> looking to improve how they
      forecast and plan their work.

        >(One note: Larger organizations with very big teams might find a
        full-group Planning Poker session cumbersome if dozens of people are
        estimating together. In such cases, breaking into smaller groups or
        using a representative from each sub-team to play can help. The method
        scales best with smaller teams, as

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: Why Use Planning Poker?</h2>
    <p>
      Planning Poker has cemented its place as a valuable tool in the Agile
      toolkit for good reason. By turning estimation into a collaborative and
      engaging game, it effectively sidesteps common pitfalls like anchoring
      bias and ensures all team members contribute their unique perspectives.
      The structured process of private voting followed by open discussion not
      only leads to more realistic and collectively owned estimates but also
      serves as a powerful mechanism for knowledge sharing and clarifying
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      While particularly popular in software development, its core principles of
      leveraging group wisdom and fostering consensus are applicable to any team
      needing to estimate complex work. Whether you're estimating user stories,
      campaign tasks, or project phases, Planning Poker offers a practical,
      often fun, way to improve forecasting accuracy, build team alignment, and
      ultimately deliver better results. It transforms estimation from a
      potentially contentious chore into a valuable team-building exercise
      focused on shared understanding.
