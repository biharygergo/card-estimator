          A previous Planning Poker account has already been linked to this
          Google account. We currently do not support linking multiple accounts,
          but it is on the roadmap.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a workaround, you can sign out of this anonymous account and sign
          back in with your permanent account. You'll lose access to rooms
          created with your current account. If you really need the linking
          feature, put some friendly pressure on the developers and file an
          issue on Github.
