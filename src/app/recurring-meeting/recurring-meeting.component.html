          Oh-oh, something does not seem to work. To join a recurring meeting,
          you need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>have a valid recurring meeting link,</li>
          <li>be signed in to your permanent PlanningPoker.live account,</li>
          <li>and be a member of the host's organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you think something is still wrong, reach out to us at
          info@planningpoker.live.
