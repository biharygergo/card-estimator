          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            Planning poker, also called SCRUM poker or pointing poker, is a
            consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used to
            estimate effort or relative size of development goals in software
            development.
          </p>
        </mat-expansion-panel>

          <mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <mat-panel-title>How to play?</mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
            In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing
            numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them
            aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed.
            By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive
            bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a
            precedent for subsequent estimates.
          </p>
          <p>
            When played online, members are together in a real-time estimation
            "room" or "session" and their cards are displayed on the screen. The
            same rules apply, but everything is more convenient and automated.
          </p>
          <p>
            A planning poker session is usually around 30 minutes long, and is
            lead by a SCRUM master or team-lead. The game allows each member to
            contribute to project planning and encourages lively discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game can be played with different card sets which denote story
            points or developer hours, depending on the team's taste. Card sets
            can be configured when the game is started.
